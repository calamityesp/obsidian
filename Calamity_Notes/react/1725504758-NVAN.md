#### Adding the Project Files
---

1) Create a new folder to hold your project
    ```bash
    mkdir <project name>
    ```

2) Inside your project folder create a src folder to hold your  application files
    ```bash
    cd <project name> 
    mkdir src
    ```
3) From the root of the project, initialize `npm` to generate project json files to keep track
   of dependencies
```bash
    npm init -y
```
    -- note you can use npm to install all of your packages: TODO make a npm section
