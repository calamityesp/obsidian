<h1>React useEffect()</h1>

Import: `import {useEffect} from 'react'`

Description:
- React useEffect is a react "hook" that runs a function after the component renders. It is used for side effects
 such as fetching data, updating dom, setting timers, etc. 

- you can control when it runs by passing dependencies in an array


---
#### Most common use cases
---


###### Run on every component render
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Log this on ever component render')
})
```


###### Run once after initial render (NOTE)
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('This will log once after the inital render, and wont run again')
}, []) //adding the array after tells react not to rerender this effect unless you add dependencies
       // note: if you get an error, its ok to use the lsp to disable exhaustive-dependencies
```


###### Run when state, or property changes
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('This will run when state has changed')
}, [state]) // same as above but it will run because you added a state dependency
```



###### Cleanup after the effect (eg. removing event listners)
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Timer is running")
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(timer); //cleanup timer
}, [])
```
