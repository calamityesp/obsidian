<h1>React Jsx Dynamic Values</h1>
</center>


In React, dynamic values are often used to make components more flexible. Instead of hardcoding data, you can use
variables and state to update the content based on changes or user interactions.


---
#### Using Variables
---

In your jsx code you use curley braces to insert javascript variables into your jsx 
```javascript
function Greeting() {
  const name = "John";                        // declared the name variables
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;             // use the name variable in my jsx
}
```

---
#### Using Props
---

Props are just parameters passed to components

```javascript
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Sarah" />;
}
```


---
#### Using State
---

Lets you change values when an event happens

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial count is 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Dynamically Setting Html Attributes
---




---
#### Dynamically setting Images
---

Its not best practice to hard code image locations in your img src attribute, here is the best way to do it in 
react

- Your react app gets bundled, hard coding image src locations can be ignored in the build process and not get bundled
- You dont get to take advantage of optimization steps

You should `import` your images into your component file with a relative path to the image file. (you can also use blob
storage url and all that). But here is how you do it
- normally javascript you cant import images in javascript, but the code that allows you to convert jsx will also allow
  you to add the image during the building / bundling stage of your application
```javascript
import React from "react";
import logo from './logo.png'; // Import the image

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <img src={logo} alt="App Logo" /> {/* Use the image */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

#### Props   ---- Everything you need to Know About them
---

- We can use props to make data reusable. Above we discussed passing in parameters to components, so lets use those to
  reusable components. Some things you can do with props:
  - Access Data passed to the component
```javascript
      function Greeting(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
      }
```
  - Destructure props For simplicity
```javascript
      // in stead of accessing props.name  you can destructure it as long as it matches the attribute of the prop

      <Greeting name="Myname" />              // here we pass in MyName

      function Greeting({ name }) {           // here we destructure it and access my name
        return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
      }
```

  - Pass functions as props
```javascript
      function Button({ onClick }) {
        return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
      }

      function App() {
        const handleClick = () => alert("Button clicked!");
        return <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
      }
```
  - Use the special children prop which is automatically passed to every component that will allow you to read child
    elements between your component jsx tags
        - This is called `component composition`

```javascript
      function Container(props) {
        return <div className="container">{props.children}</div>;
      }

      function App() {
        return (        //We declare the container component, and above, access the child elements
          <Container>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>This content is inside the container.</p>
          </Container>
        );
      }
```
