## Purpose
Explain how to initialize a new Git project to start version control for your
files and directories.

## Prerequisites

  - Version: 2.0 or higher recommended.

- **Permissions**: Access to the directory you want to track.

- **Knowledge**: Basic familiarity with the command line.


## Steps

1. **Step 1**: Navigate to project directory
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/project
    ```

2. **Step 2**: Initialize GIT repo
    ```bash

    ```

3. **Step 3**: Configure user information (If not done)

4. **Step 4**: Add files to staging
     ```bash
     git add . ; git commit -m "your message"
     ```

## Expected Outcome
- A new Git repository is initialized.

- A `.git` directory is created in the project folder.

- The initial commit is made, and the repository is ready for version control.
 Describe what should happen after completing the procedure.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: "git: command not found"
  - **Solution**: Ensure Git is installed and added to your system's PATH.

- **Issue**: "Permission denied"
  - **Solution**: Verify you have write permissions for the directory.
