#### Git Merge
---

Git merge is a command that integrates changes from one branch into another. When you perform a merge, 
Git combines the histories of the branches, creating a new commit if necessary. The process can be simple 
or involve conflicts that need to be resolved if the branches have diverged significantly.


| Command/Option             | Description                                                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git merge <branch>`       | Merges the specified branch into the current branch.                              |
| `git merge --no-ff`        | Forces a merge commit, even if fast-forward is possible.                          |
| `git merge --ff-only`      | Only merges if it can be fast-forwarded; aborts otherwise.                        |
| `git merge --squash`       | Combines changes into a single commit without merging the branch.                 |
| `git merge --abort`        | Cancels the merge and reverts to the pre-merge state.                             |
| `git merge --no-commit`    | Merges changes but doesn't commit automatically.                                  |
| `git merge --strategy=<strategy>` | Uses a specified merge strategy (e.g., `recursive`, `resolve`).          |
| `git merge --stat`         | Shows a summary of changes during the merge.                                      |
| `git merge --log`          | Adds a log of merged commits to the merge commit message.                         |





######  Fast Forward Merge 
\---------------------------
Simplest type of merge

1) We branch off main and create delete_vscode branch
```
      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main

```

2) Run the following while on main 
```bash
git merge delete_vscode
```
  - then you will get this

```bash
            delete_vscode
A - B - C   main
```
This is because git will automatically fast-forward merge it since delete_vscode has all of the commits that main has

- git just moves the pointer to delete_vscode merger






---
#### Git Rebase
---

Git rebase is a command that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
Unlike merging, which preserves the history of all branches, rebasing creates a linear history by placing
you'd changes on top of the latest changes from another branch.

tldr: You can replay your branch on top of the merge_to_branch so that it acts as if the changes in your branch 
      were commit after the changes in merge_to_branch


why?: Allows you to keep a linear history

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git rebase <branch>`         | Re-applies your commits on top of the specified branch.                            |
| `git rebase --interactive`    | Opens an editor to choose how each commit is handled (reword, squash, etc.).       |
| `git rebase --onto <newbase>` | Re-applies commits onto a new base.                                                |
| `git rebase --continue`       | Continues the rebase after resolving conflicts.                                    |
| `git rebase --abort`          | Cancels the rebase and reverts to the original state.                              |
| `git rebase --skip`           | Skips the current commit during the rebase.                                        |
| `git rebase --preserve-merges`| Preserves merge commits during the rebase.                                         |
| `git rebase --autosquash`     | Automatically squashes commits marked for squashing during interactive rebase.     |
| `git rebase -i --root`        | Starts an interactive rebase from the first commit.                                |
| `git rebase --exec <command>` | Runs a command on each commit during the rebase.                                   |
