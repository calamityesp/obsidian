#### What is a Branch?
---



- Allows you to keep  track of different changes seperately
- under the hood its just a named pointer to a specific commit

- these branches are cheap because they are just pointers

```bash
git branch
```
![[Pasted image 20240821124123.png]]
		- We only have a master branch because it was the one set in the global settings

They are called branches because when you create one they can kind of diverge.. Here is an example for reference:
```
       G - H    lanes_branch
      /
A - B - C - D   main
  \
   E - F        primes_branch
```

#### Remote Branches
---

###### Deleting Remote Branches
\---------------------------

```bash
git push -d <remote_name> <branchname>
```



---
#### Switch Command
---

switch command is just a subjectively better way for handling branching

| Command                                | Description                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git switch <branch-name>`             | Switches to the specified branch.                                                  |
| `git switch -c <new-branch-name>`      | Creates and switches to a new branch.                                              |
| `git switch -C <branch-name>`          | Forces creation and switches to the new branch, even if it exists.                 |
| `git switch --orphan <new-branch-name>`| Creates a new branch without history (orphan branch).                              |
| `git switch --detach`                  | Switches to a commit, detaching the HEAD.                                          |
| `git switch -`                         | Switches back to the previous branch.                                              |
| `git switch --discard-changes`         | Switches branches and discards local changes.                                      |
| `git switch --track <remote>/<branch>` | Switches to a new branch that tracks a remote branch.                              |
| `git switch --create <branch-name>`    | Creates a new branch (alias for `-c`).                                             |
| `git switch --force`                   | Forces the switch even if there are uncommitted changes.                           |
| `git switch --no-track`                | Creates a new branch without tracking the remote branch.                           |
