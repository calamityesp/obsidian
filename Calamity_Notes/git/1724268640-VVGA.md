<h1>Git Files </h1>
</center>

Git files are essential components of a Git repository that manage everything from configuration settings to the
actual storage of data. These files are generally hidden in the .git/ directory at the root of a repository and 
include configurations, references to commits, and objects that store the data of your project. Understanding these 
files can help you better manage and troubleshoot your Git repository.


| Git File/Directory        | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.git/`                   | The main directory that contains all the data and configurations for the Git repository.          |
| `.git/config`             | Stores repository-specific configuration settings.                                                |
| `.gitignore`              | Defines files and directories that Git should ignore.                                             |
| `.gitattributes`          | Controls file-specific attributes like line endings and diff behavior.                            |
| `.git/HEAD`               | Points to the current branch or commit.                                                           |
| `.git/index`              | Tracks changes that are staged for the next commit (staging area).                                |
| `.git/refs/`              | Stores pointers to commit objects for branches, tags, and other references.                       |
| `.git/refs/heads/`        | Contains references to the heads of local branches.                                               |
| `.git/refs/remotes/`      | Contains references to remote-tracking branches.                                                  |
| `.git/objects/`           | Stores all the content (blobs, trees, commits, tags) as compressed objects.                       |
| `.git/logs/`              | Keeps logs of changes to the refs, tracking the history of the HEAD and branches.                 |
| `.git/hooks/`             | Contains scripts that are executed at various points in the Git workflow, like pre-commit or post-merge. |
| `.git/info/exclude`       | A local `.gitignore` file that applies only to the specific repository, useful for personal ignores.|
| `.git/packed-refs`        | Stores packed references to save space and improve performance by consolidating loose refs.       |
| `.git/description`        | Used by GitWeb to describe the repository, mostly irrelevant for typical Git operations.           |
