<h1>(Procedure) Azure CI Pipelines</h1>
</center>


##### __Procedure Description__
Azure CI (Continuous Integration) pipelines automatically build, test, and
validate your code changes when pushed to a repository, ensuring code quality
and integration with other components.

##### Use Case
A team commits changes to a shared repository. The CI pipeline triggers
automatically, builds the application, runs tests, and provides feedback. If
successful, the code is ready for deployment, ensuring no broken code reaches
production.


##### Notes
- Microsoft is pushing for the use of `YAML` based deployment vs classic
  pipelines so this file will be using YAML unless I come across classic 
  pipelines in the future (unlikely)

- this assumes that all of these services are registered on azure cloud platform

- note: refresh on :
    [Deployment Groups](azure/devops/1734997349-YXXC.md) - multi server deployment
    [Azure Agents](azure/1735001201-DNOC.md) - on prem / non cloud services you want
                   exposure to azure cloud service


##### __Building Good CI Pipeline__
There are some things to be mindful about when writing your CI pipeline
(not in order of priority)

1. Build Validation
- restore all dependencies
- ensure code compiles and builds (docker image, dotnet build, etc)

2. Automated Testing
- `Unit Tests`: Run your unit test
- `Intergration Tests`: Confirm components still work together

3. Code Validation
- `Linting` : Check code style and enforce standards (ESlint, StyleCop, Etc)
- `Static Code Analyisis`: Scan the code for security vulnerabilities

4. Pipeline Triggers
- Determine what your triggers or to run this pipeline

5. Enviornment Variables and Secrets
- Manage sensitive data (api keys, connection strings, etc)

6. Versioning
- Using versioning for building artifacts to track changes
  (semantic versioning, etc)

7. Artifact Management
- Store build outputs (dll, .zip) for later use or deployment

8. Notifications
- Notify team of pipeline status (success, failure) using email, or messaging

9. Pipeline Cachine
- speed up builds by reusing dependencies or Docker Layers

10. Branch Policies
- Enforce Rules ( builds must pass before merge), check code quality before 
  merging

11. Repository Management
- Clean up unused branches and stale artifacts to maintain project health

#### Procedure 1: Create the Azure Service Registry
---

1)  Navigate to Azure Devops Project 
    - url: `dev.azure.com/[organization name]`

2)  Navigate to Project settings and locate service connections

![[Pasted image 20241224101651.png|400]]

3)  Create 2 service connections for your project
      [Azure Service Connection](azure/1734971713-DKJQ.md)
      a) For app service you're deploying the app to
      b) For the Azure Container Registry



---
#### Procedure 2: Create a New Pipeline
---

1) Select the pipelines tab in your azure devops project
![[Pasted image 20241224103251.png|300]]

2) Select `Create Pipeline`
![[Pasted image 20241224103441.png]]

3) Select Azure Repos Git
![[Pasted image 20241224103605.png|300]]

4) Select repository
![[Pasted image 20241224103711.png|500]]

5) Either select Stater pipeline or existing azure pipeline YAML file
![[Pasted image 20241224103850.png|500]]

- if you created the `azure-piplines.yml` file in your project, select use
  existing, select the file, and it should display your created yaml file


---
#### Procedure 3: Write out your YAML file
---
__Creating Stages in your YAML file__
- this procedure assumes we are starting a yaml file from scratch, feel free to 
  edit an existing one if necessary

1) Follow [(Procedure) Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline](azure/devops/1735272570-ZONR.md)
   to create a layout of your azure pipeline
