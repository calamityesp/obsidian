<h1>Understanding Azure Agent</h1>

##### __Feature Description__
Azure Agents are applications that run tasks in Azure DevOps pipelines, such
as building code, running tests, or deploying applications.

##### Use Case
Execute pipeline jobs on your infrastructure (self-hosted agents) or on
Microsoft-hosted VMs (Microsoft-hosted agents).

##### Example of When to Use
Imagine you have a web application that needs to be built, tested, and
deployed to an on-premises server in your company's private network.

    Scenario:
      You want to automate this process using Azure DevOps pipelines, but the 
      build and deployment require access to internal company resources that 
      aren't accessible from the cloud.

__How It Works:__

Install a Self-Hosted Agent on one of your internal servers.
This agent connects to Azure DevOps and listens for pipeline jobs.
When the pipeline runs, the agent executes the tasks (e.g., builds the code,
runs tests, and deploys the app) using your internal environment.

__Use Case:__

Build and deploy apps that rely on private resources.
Customize the agent environment with special tools or software needed for your project.
Azure agents are ideal for automating tasks in pipelines, whether running in 
the cloud (Microsoft-hosted) or in your private infrastructure (self-hosted).
