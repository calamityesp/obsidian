<h1>Azure Devops YAML Triggers </h1>
</center>


##### __Feature Description__
Define the event or condition that will execute the pipeline


##### Quick Syntax
__Basic Use__
- Set the pipeline to trigger with `pr` on main or develop
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - develop
```

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      We want to run the pipeline when ever we commit code too develop branch


__How It Works:__
We use the `trigger` keyword as well as sub keywords to trigger on main branch


##### Trigger Key Properties
```yaml
| **Property**   | **Description**                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `branches`     | Include/exclude branches for triggering.            |
| `paths`        | Include/exclude file paths for triggering.          |
| `tags`         | Include/exclude tags for triggering.                |
| `batch`        | Batch changes into one build.                       |
| `maxConcurrent`| Max concurrent builds.                              |
| `enabled`      | Enable/disable the trigger.                         |
| `stages`       | Trigger based on completed stages.                  |
```

---
#### Branch Property
---
- Including a branch as a trigger means the pipeline runs only when changes
  are pushed to the specified branch(es).
- You can also exclude branches as a trigger

__Branch Sub-Properties__
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include: [string]  # List of branch names to include
    exclude: [string]  # List of branch names to exclude
```


---
#### Path Property
---
- Triggers pipeline when changes are made to files in a specific path

##### Example Use Case
- You want this particular pipeline to run when their are changes to the
  `docs/` path

##### Wild Cards
- you can use wild cards like `docs/*` but this is optional here because the 
  pipeline would trigger whenever there are changes to the `docs/` path

##### Branch Sub-Properties
```yaml
trigger:
  paths:
    include: [string]  # specify paths to trigger the pipeline
    exclude: [string]  # specify paths to ignore for pipelines
```


---
#### Tags Property
---
- Triggers the pipeline when changes are associated with specific tags.

##### Example Use Case
- You want the pipeline to run only for commits tagged with `v1.*`.

##### Wild Cards
- You can use wildcards like `v1.*` to match patterns of tags.
- Specific tags (e.g., `v1.0`) can also be included or excluded.

##### Sub-Properties
```yaml
trigger:
  tags:
    include: [string]  # Specify tags to trigger the pipeline
    exclude: [string]  # Specify tags to ignore for the pipeline
```


---
#### Batch Property
---
- Controls whether multiple changes are batched into a single pipeline run.

##### Example Use Case
If multiple commits are pushed to the main branch in a short time, enabling
batch: true will group them into a single pipeline run instead of triggering
separate runs for each commit. This reduces build overhead.

##### Sub-Properties
- **batch**: A boolean (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable batching.
```yaml
trigger:
  batch: true  # Enable batching for pipeline triggers
```


---
#### MaxConcurrent Property
---
- Limits the maximum number of pipeline runs that can execute concurrently for
  a trigger.

##### Example Use Case
- You want to restrict the pipeline to run only 2 concurrent builds for
  resource management.

      Scenario:
        If multiple commits are pushed to the `main` branch, no more than 2
        builds will run simultaneously, while others will queue. This helps
        manage build server resources.

##### Sub-Properties
- **maxConcurrent**: An integer to specify the maximum number of concurrent pipeline runs.

##### 
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
  maxConcurrent: 2
```


---
#### Enabled Property
---
- Enables or disables a trigger without removing it from the YAML file.

##### Example Use Case
- You temporarily want to disable the trigger for testing or maintenance purposes.

Example: Setting `enabled: false` prevents the pipeline from triggering for
changes to the `main` branch, while keeping the configuration in place for
future use.

##### Sub-Properties
- **enabled**: A boolean (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable the trigger.

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
  enabled: false
```


---
#### Stages Property
---
- Specifies that the pipeline triggers only after certain named stages are completed.

- This property is usually dependent on the stages being executed in another 
  pipeline and you do that through `Azure Pipeline Resources`

##### Example Use Case
- You want the pipeline to trigger only after specific stages in another pipeline complete successfully.

##### Sub-Properties
- **stages**: A list of stage names that must complete before triggering the pipeline.

```yaml
trigger:
  stages:
    - Build  # Name of the stage for compiling the code
    - Test   # Name of the stage for running tests
```


---
#### COMPLEX EXAMPLE
---
- Here is an example of a complex use of the Triggers Property
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - feature/*
    exclude:
      - experimental/*
  paths:
    include:
      - src/
      - config/*
    exclude:
      - docs/
  tags:
    include:
      - v1.*
    exclude:
      - beta/*
  batch: true
  maxConcurrent: 3
  enabled: true
  stages:
    - Build
    - Test
```
Explanation:

- The pipeline triggers on changes to the main branch or any branch starting with
  feature/, except experimental/*.

- It only runs if changes are made within src/ or config/* paths, excluding
  docs/.

- The pipeline runs for commits tagged with v1.* but skips those tagged with
  beta/*.

- Multiple changes are batched into a single pipeline run, with up to 3
  concurrent builds allowed.

- The trigger is enabled and activates only after the Build and Test stages
  are successfully completed.
