### Expected Outcome
- A functional Azure DevOps pipeline is created and configured.
- The pipeline triggers automatically based on branch updates or other specified criteria.
- The pipeline performs tasks like building, testing, and deploying the application.

### Troubleshooting
- **Error: "Pipeline not triggering"**: Ensure the `trigger` section in the YAML file includes the correct branches.
- **Error: "Permission denied"**: Verify service connections and pipeline permissions.
- **Error: "Task failed"**: Check the logs for specific error messages and verify task configurations.

### Additional Notes
- Use pipeline variables to manage configurations dynamically.
- Test the pipeline incrementally to identify issues early.
- Refer to the [Azure DevOps Pipeline Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/) for detailed guidance.
