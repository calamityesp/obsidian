<h1>Azure YAML Variables</h1>

##### __Feature Description__
Azure Variables store values used across pipelines to simplify workflows,
manage configurations, and pass data between jobs or stages.

##### Use Case
Use Azure Variables to define reusable values such as branch names,
environment types, or deployment settings.

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      A team deploys an app to multiple environments (e.g., staging,
      production). Variables like EnvironmentName and BuildConfiguration are
      used to standardize settings and avoid duplication in the pipeline 
      configuration.

__How It Works:__
1.  Define variables in the variables section or set them dynamically during 
    runtime.
2.  Access variables using $(VariableName) for runtime or 
    `variables['VariableName']` in expressions.
3.  Use these variables to control steps, tasks, or stages dynamically.

__Implementation Steps:__
1.  Define variables in the `variables` section of your pipeline.
2.  Use `variables['VariableName']` in conditions or steps to reference the value.
3.  Set runtime variables during execution using pipeline tasks or scripts.
4.  Ensure variables are passed between jobs if needed by defining them
    globally or explicitly.

__Practical Example__
```yaml
variables:
  EnvironmentName: staging
  BuildConfiguration: Release

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        steps:
          - script: |
              echo "Building in ${{ variables['BuildConfiguration'] }} mode for ${{ variables['EnvironmentName'] }} environment"
            displayName: "Print Build Info"

  - stage: Deploy
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: DeployJob
        condition: eq(variables['EnvironmentName'], 'staging')
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deploying to Staging Environment"
            displayName: "Deploy Staging"

      - job: DeployProdJob
        condition: eq(variables['EnvironmentName'], 'production')
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deploying to Production Environment"
            displayName: "Deploy Production"
```

#### Understanding `${{variables['variablename']}}` vs `variables['VariableName']`
#### vs `$(variableName)`
---

__Quick Rule__

1. `${{ variables['VariableName'] }}`:
    Use during template parsing time ( __before__ pipeline runs).
    - Example: Dynamic setup of jobs, stages, or conditions at the start.

2. `variables['VariableName']`:
    Use in conditions evaluated at runtime.
    - Example: Controlling whether a job or step runs.

3. `$(VariableName)`:
    Use inside scripts or tasks during runtime.
    - Example: Direct accessing values in a shell command.


Simple Summary:
- `${{ }}`: Setup time.
- `variables['']`: Runtime conditions.
- `$()`: Inside scripts/tasks.
