---
### Procedure
---

1) Define your [Triggers](azure/devops/1735273582-LJET.md)
  - what triggers your pipeline to start

2) Define your [Variables](azure/devops/1735188478-DUJN.md)
  - data that you will use and reuse in your pipeline
  - note: its recommended to use a `library` to store all of your configuration
          data instead of defining variables in your pipeline yaml

3) Define your [Stages](azure/devops/1735304297-SNAY.md)
  - Determine the pipeline sections you want (like Build, Test, Deploy, Etc)

4) Under stages, determine your [Jobs](azure/devops/1735337215-HTPV.md)
  - Once youu define youur stages, this is where you actually write how to 
    perform the actions at each stage
