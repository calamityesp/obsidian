<h1>Software Procedure: Create a Self Hosted Agent </h1>
</center>


### Purpose
This procedure outlines the steps to set up a self-hosted agent for Azure
DevOps to enable builds, deployments, and pipelines to run on your own
infrastructure instead of Microsoft's hosted agents.

### Prerequisites
System Requirements:
- Windows, macOS, or Linux system with at least 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM.
- Internet connectivity to communicate with Azure DevOps.

Software:
- Azure DevOps CLI (optional but helpful).
- Latest version of a supported .NET runtime (if needed for specific builds).

Permissions:
- Admin rights on the machine for installation and configuration.
- Access to Azure DevOps Organization and the ability to add agents to a pool.

Agent Pool:
- Ensure an agent pool exists in Azure DevOps, or create one before setup.

note: Instructions come from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser)

### Steps
--- 
1. **Step 1**: Open commandline with administrator privileges

2. **Step 2**: Create the Directory where you want to unpack the agent files
    - Will be using powershell with "linux" like aliases for some commands
     ```powershell
     #create the directory (this is using mkdir alias)
     mkdir C:\agents
     ```
3. **Step 3**: Download the self-hosted agent
   - Navigate to Organization Settings
   - Select Agent Pool
   - Select Default Agent Pool
   - Select New Agent
![[Pasted image 20250112105050.png|400]]
   - In the get the agent tab, follow the instructions for installing your agent
    > Microsoft is dumb, if you copy the code, remove the PS C:\> from the code
      prompt. You will extract the agent into your downloads

4. **Step 4**: Configure the agent. Here are some things to note: 
    - server URL  =   `https://dev.azure.com/[organization]`
    - To setup PAT (personal access token):
