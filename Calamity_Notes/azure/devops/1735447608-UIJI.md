<h1>Azure DevOps YAML Basics</h1>

##### __Feature Description__
Azure DevOps YAML pipelines allow you to define your build and release
workflows as code, enabling automation, version control, and reusability.

##### Use Case
Use YAML pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying
applications in a consistent, repeatable manner.

##### Quick Syntax
```yaml
trigger:
- main                                        # Branch that triggers the pipeline

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'                    # Agent to run the pipeline

steps:
- script: echo "Step 1: Run a script"         # Define a task
- bash: ./script.sh                           # Run a Bash script
- task: UseDotNet@2                           # Run a specific task
  inputs:
    command: restore                          # Task-specific input
```

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You want to automatically build and deploy a web application when code
      is pushed to the main branch.

__How It Works:__
1. trigger: Defines the branch that starts the pipeline.
2. pool:    Specifies the environment (e.g., hosted Ubuntu agent).
3. steps:   Lists the actions to perform, such as running scripts or deploying
            code.

__Practical Example:__
```yaml
trigger:
- main

stages:
- stage: BuildAndDeploy
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: "Build Application"
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building the app"

  - job: Deploy
    displayName: "Deploy Application"
    dependsOn: Build
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying the app to production"
```

##### Top-Level Keys
| **Top-Level Key**           | **Description**                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| trigger                 | Defines branches or events that trigger the pipeline.                           |
| pr                      | Specifies pull request triggers.                                                |
| resources               | References external resources like repositories, containers, and packages.      |
| variables               | Declares pipeline-wide variables.                                               |
| stages                  | Groups jobs into logical stages for sequential or parallel execution.           |
| jobs                    | Defines the jobs to execute within the pipeline.                                |
| steps                   | Specifies tasks or scripts to run in a job.                                     |
| pool                    | Defines the agent pool for the pipeline or jobs.                                |
| strategy                | Configures job execution strategy, like matrix or parallel runs.                |
| schedules               | Sets up scheduled triggers for pipeline execution.                              |
| extends                 | Allows extending the pipeline from a predefined template.                       |
| services                | Lists required services during pipeline execution.                              |
| timeoutInMinutes        | Sets the maximum runtime for the pipeline or jobs.                              |
| cancelTimeoutInMinutes  | Specifies cleanup time after a cancellation.                                    |
| workspace               | Configures workspace behavior, such as cleaning directories.                    |



##### Concurrency
If you need your pipeline to run concurrently, then you use the stages keyword
at the top level

If you do not need concurrency, then skip the stages, and just use the STEPS
