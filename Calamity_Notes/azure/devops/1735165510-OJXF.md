<h1>Azure Pipelines Stages</h1>
</center>


##### __Feature Description__
Stages in Azure DevOps pipelines divide the pipeline into logical sections
(e.g., build, test, deploy), allowing for better organization and control over
workflows.


##### Example of When to Use
(give imagine description using a real world example)

    Scenario:
      You are deploying a new feature for a SaaS platform. You want to:
        1. Build the application and ensure all dependencies are resolved.
        2. Run tests to validate functionality.
        3. Deploy to staging for QA approval.
        4. Deploy to production only after approval.

__How It Works:__
1. Define stages for **Build**, **Test**, **Staging Deployment**, and **Production Deployment** in your pipeline YAML file.  
2. Each stage runs its associated tasks sequentially or in parallel.  
3. Add conditions or approvals between stages to control when they proceed.


__Practical Example Case:__

- We will implement the above scenario in a yaml file
- note: This is just an example, commands may differ for azure pipelines
```yaml
#  -----------------------------
#       Pipeline Trigger
#  -----------------------------
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

#  -----------------------------
#    Pipeline Stages Begin
#      1. build
#      2. test
#      3. QA deployment
#      4. production deployment
#  -----------------------------
stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: "Build Stage"
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        steps:
          - script: echo "Building the application..."
          - script: dotnet build MyApp.sln

#  -----------------------------
#             Test
#  -----------------------------
  - stage: Test
    displayName: "Test Stage"
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: TestJob
        steps:
          - script: echo "Running tests..."
          - script: dotnet test MyApp.Tests.sln

#  -----------------------------
#         QA Deployment
#  -----------------------------
  - stage: DeployToStaging
    displayName: "Deploy to Staging"
    dependsOn: Test
    jobs:
      - job: DeployStagingJob
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deploying application to Staging..."
          - script: echo "Staging deployment complete."

#  -----------------------------
#       Production Deployment
#  -----------------------------
  - stage: DeployToProduction
    displayName: "Deploy to Production"
    dependsOn: DeployToStaging
    jobs:
      - job: DeployProductionJob
        steps:
          - script: echo "Deploying application to Production..."
          - script: echo "Production deployment complete."
    approval:
      checks:
        - approval:
            name: "Manual Approval"
            reviewers:
              - john.doe@example.com
              - jane.smith@example.com
```
