Azure YAML pipelines define CI/CD workflows as code, allowing for automation,
version control, and easy customization.

##### Use Case
Use YAML to configure builds, tests, and deployments for applications in a
single pipeline file that integrates with version control systems like Git.

##### Quick Reference

#### Azure YAML Structure
---
```YAML
- Pipeline
  - Stage A
    - Job 1
      - Step 1.1
      - Step 1.2
      - Step ...

    - Job 2
      - Step 2.1
      - Step 2.2
      - Step ...

  - Stage B
    - ...
```

#### Simple Pipeline Example
---
- This represents a simple step by step example of how to create a yaml pipeline
  file

1.  Identify your  repository and create a develop branch (we will use the dev 
    branch as a trigger later)

2.  Create a file `azure-pipelines.yml` in your project directory

3.  write the following in the `yml` file (it does nothing but echo)
```yml
name: $(Date:yyyyMMdd)$(Rev:.r)
variables:
  var1: value1
jobs:
  -job: One
    steps:
      - script: echo first step!
```
- name is using Azure Devops [Built In Variables](####Azure_Builtin_Variables) to create build names

4.  Commit the yaml file to the develop branch

5.

#### Azure_Builtin_Variables
---
-  these are some variables that are created when yaml files are loaded
