##### __Feature Description__
The `jobs` property in Azure Pipelines defines units of work within a stage.
Jobs are required to be nested under a `stage` property and cannot exist on
their own.

Important! - This is a property under [Stages](azure/devops/1735304297-SNAY.md)

##### Use Case
Use the `jobs` property to split tasks into manageable units within a stage,
enabling parallelism, isolation, and better organization.

##### Quick Syntax
```yaml
stages:
- stage: ExampleStage
  jobs:                           #Start of jobs
  - job: JobName
    displayName: "Human-readable name"
    dependsOn: PreviousJob
    condition: succeeded()
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    variables:
      myVariable: "value"
    steps:
      - script: echo "Running steps in the job"
```

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You are working on a CI/CD pipeline for a web application. The pipeline
      includes three key tasks: building the application, running tests, and
      deploying the app to production. These tasks need to run in a specific
      sequence to ensure that only successful builds and tests lead to
      deployment.

__How It Works:__
1.  BuildJob:   Compiles and packages the code.
2.  TestJob:    Runs unit and integration tests, ensuring the build is stable.
3.  DeployJob:  Deploys the application to production only if all previous jobs
                are successful.


__Practical Example:__
```yaml
stages:
- stage: BuildAndDeploy
  displayName: "Build, Test, and Deploy Pipeline"
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    displayName: "Build Application"
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building the application"

  - job: TestJob
    displayName: "Run Tests"
    dependsOn: BuildJob
    condition: succeeded()  # Only run tests if the build succeeds
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running tests"

  - job: DeployJob
    displayName: "Deploy to Production"
    dependsOn: TestJob
    condition: succeeded()  # Only deploy if tests pass
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying to production"
```

| `outputs`            | Pass variables to dependent jobs.                  |

note: All properties are sub-properties of the job property and job is required
      to use them

#### Steps Property
---
- **Short Description**
    The `steps` property defines the list of tasks or commands to execute within
    a job.

##### Example Use Case
- Use the `steps` property to define the actions required to build, test, or
  deploy your application, such as running scripts, installing dependencies,
  or publishing artifacts.

##### Features of the `steps` Property
- Execute shell scripts or commands (`script`, `bash`, `pwsh`).
- Perform specific tasks using predefined `task`.
- Handle repository actions like `checkout` and `publish`.
- Apply conditional logic with `condition`.

##### Steps Sub-Properties
