<h1>(Procedure) Creating New Deployment Group</h1>
</center>


##### __Procedure Description__
Creating a DevOps procedure for a new deployment group involves setting up a 
collection of servers (VMs or on-prem machines) in Azure DevOps where your 
application will be deployed. This includes configuring deployment targets and 
installing deployment agents.


##### Use Case
Deploy an application to multiple servers simultaneously, such as on-premises
environments or Azure VMs, with centralized management through Azure DevOps.

note: we will not be creating multiple servers in this procedure, just setting 
      up the deployment group
