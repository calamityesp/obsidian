<h1>Azure DevOps YAML Stages</h1>
</center>


##### __Feature Description__
The `stages` key in Azure DevOps YAML defines a sequence of steps grouped into
logical units. Stages allow for parallelism, dependency control, and
organizing workflows.

NOTE: use stages ONLY when you need concurrency, otherwise just use `steps`

##### Use Case
Divide the pipeline into defined phases such as Build, Test, Deploy

##### Quick Syntax
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building the application"

- stage: Test
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - job: TestJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running tests"

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Test
  jobs:
  - job: DeployJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying to production"
```

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You have a CI/CD pipeline that builds code, runs tests, and deploys to
      production. Each phase requires isolation and controlled execution based
      on success.


__How It Works:__
- Define each stage with its jobs, dependencies, and conditions.
- Stages can run sequentially or in parallel.
- Use `dependsOn` to specify execution order.

__Real World Application:__
Organize complex workflows into phases, enabling better resource utilization and error isolation. For example:
- Stage 1: Build the application.
- Stage 2: Run automated tests.
- Stage 3: Deploy artifacts to production if tests pass.



##### Stages Key Properties
- note: the `stage` property is required to use any other property as shown
  in the [Stage Property Below](####stage-property)

| **Property**   | **Description**                                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stage`        | Required. Name of the stage.                                   |
| `displayName`  | Optional. Human-readable name.                                 |
| `dependsOn`    | Stages this one depends on. Defaults to the previous stage.    |
| `condition`    | When the stage runs. Defaults to `succeeded()`.                |
| `pool`         | Pool for running jobs in the stage.                            |
| `variables`    | Stage-specific variables.                                      |
| `jobs`         | List of jobs to run in this stage.                             |
| `lockBehavior` | Stage locking behavior. E.g., `runLatest`, `sequential`.       |


---
#### Stage Property
---
- **REQUIRED**
- The `stage` property defines a logical grouping of jobs in a pipeline, such
  as Build, Test, or Deploy.

- you need the stage property set in order to set dependsOn, jobs, and condition
  property because they are specific to the stage

##### Example Use Case
- Use the `stage` property to organize pipeline workflows into distinct phases
  that can run sequentially or in parallel.

##### Sub-Properties
| **Sub-Property** | **Description**                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `displayName`    | Human-readable name for the stage. Optional.                  |
| `dependsOn`      | Specifies other stages this stage depends on.                 |
| `condition`      | Determines if the stage runs based on conditions.             |
| `pool`           | Defines the pool for jobs in this stage.                      |
| `variables`      | Stage-specific variables.                                     |
| `jobs`           | List of jobs to execute in the stage.                         |
| `lockBehavior`   | Controls concurrent execution behavior for the stage.         |

##### Practical Example:
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: "Build Stage"          # Human-readable name for clarity
  pool:                               # Specifies the agent pool
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  variables:                          # Stage-specific variables
    buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  jobs:                               # Jobs to execute in this stage
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building the project"

- stage: Test
  displayName: "Test Stage"
  dependsOn: Build                    # Runs only after the Build stage
  condition: succeeded()              # Runs only if the Build stage succeeds
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  jobs:
  - job: TestJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running tests"

- stage: Deploy
  displayName: "Deploy Stage"
  dependsOn: Test                     # Runs only after the Test stage
  condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')  # Only runs on the main branch
  jobs:
  - job: DeployJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying to production"
```


---
#### `Pool` Sub-Property
---
- The `pool` property specifies the agent or environment where the jobs in the
  stage will run.

##### Example Use Case
- Use the `pool` property to define whether a stage uses a Microsoft-hosted agent,
  a self-hosted agent, or a specific virtual machine image.

##### Features of `pool` property
- Define the type of agent pool (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted).
- Specify a specific virtual machine image (e.g., `ubuntu-latest` or `windows-latest`).
- Assign a custom self-hosted pool for specialized environments.

##### Practical Example:
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Specifies a Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent

- stage: Test
  pool:
    name: 'MyCustomPool'      # Specifies a self-hosted agent pool by name

- stage: Deploy
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest' # Specifies a Microsoft-hosted Windows agent
```


---
#### Condition Sub-Property
---
- **Short Description**
  The `condition` property defines an expression that determines whether the stage will run.

##### Example Use Case
- Use the `condition` property to execute a stage only if the previous stage
  succeeds or to run a stage based on a specific branch or variable value.

##### Features of the `condition` Property
- Evaluate the status of previous stages (`succeeded()`, `failed()`).
- Use variables to control execution (`eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')`).
- Allow always running regardless of outcomes (`always()`).

| `always()`          | Always runs regardless of prior results.      | `condition: always()`                                      |
| `canceled()`        | True if the pipeline was canceled.            | `condition: canceled()`                                    |
| `succeededOrFailed()` | True if the prior task succeeded or failed. | `condition: succeededOrFailed()`                           |
| `eq(a, b)`          | True if `a` equals `b`.                           | `condition: eq(variables['Branch'], 'main')`               |
| `ne(a, b)`          | True if `a` does not equal `b`.                   | `condition: ne(variables['Branch'], 'develop')`            |
| `and(a, b, ...)`    | True if all conditions are true.              | `condition: and(succeeded(), eq(var, 'value'))`            |
| `or(a, b, ...)`     | True if any condition is true.                | `condition: or(failed(), eq(var, 'value'))`                |
| `not(a)`            | True if `a` is false.                           | `condition: not(eq(var, 'value'))`                         |


##### Condition Sub-Properties
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  condition: always()  # Always runs regardless of previous outcomes

- stage: Test
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()  # Runs only if the Build stage succeeds

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Test
  condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')  # Runs only on the main branch
```


---
#### Jobs Property
---
note: Jobs is rather extensive, so it will be getting its own page
      


- **Short Description**
  The `jobs` property defines the list of tasks or units of work to be executed
  within a stage.

##### Example Use Case
- Use the `jobs` property to divide tasks within a stage, such as building,
  testing, and deploying code.

##### Features of the `jobs` Property
- Define one or more jobs to run within a stage.
- Use `dependsOn` to manage job dependencies.
- Specify `pool`, `condition`, `variables`, and `steps` for each job.
