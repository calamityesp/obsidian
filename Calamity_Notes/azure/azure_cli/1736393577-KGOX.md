<h1>(Procedure) Deploy a Docker Image to Azure Container Registry</h1>
</center>


### Purpose
Push a Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) for use in deployments
or containerized applications.

### Prerequisites
- **Azure CLI**: Installed (`az` command available).
- **Docker**: Installed and running.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Created in your Azure account.
- **Login Permissions**: Access to ACR with push permissions.

### Steps
---
1. **Step 1**: Login to Azure (if necessary)
    - This should open browser for login, and follow the prompt to select
      your azure subscription you are logging into
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2. **Step 2**: Log in to Azure Container Registry
    - Necessary to prove you have permissions to perform operations on the 
      registry
     ```bash
     az acr login --name [name-of-registry]
     ```

3. **Step 3**: Tag the docker image for ACR
    - This makes sure the image has a unique identifier
    - Additionally, this is the url to where docker will push the image
    ```bash
    docker tag [image-name]:tag \
    [acr-registry-name].azurecr.io/[image-name]:tag
    ```
    - tag: usually the version number of the docker image

4. **Step 4**: Push the docker image to Azure ACR
     ```bash
     docker push [registry-name].azurecr.io/[image-name]:tag
     ```

5. **Step 5**: Verify the Image was pushed to ACR
     ```bash
     # check registry repository
     az acr repository list --name [registry-name] --output table

     # view tags for the image
     az acr repository show-tags --name [registry-name] --repository [app-name] \
     --output table
     ```

---

### Expected Outcome
- - The Docker image is uploaded to the specified Azure Container Registry
    and can be used for deployments.

### Troubleshooting
- **Error: "Authentication failed"**: Ensure you logged in with `az acr login`.
- **Error: "Image not found"**: Confirm the image is built and tagged correctly.
- **Error: "Permission denied"**: Verify you have push access to the registry.

### Additional Notes
- Use `docker images` to verify the image is properly tagged before pushing.
- Refer to the [Azure ACR documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/) for more details.
