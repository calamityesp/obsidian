##### __Feature Description__
Generate Dockerfiles for your project using Azure CLI to containerize
applications easily.

##### Use Case
- Package your app into a container for Azure services like App Service or AKS.
- Deploy a custom Docker image to Azure App Service.
- Prepare an app for containerized deployment to AKS.
- Migrate from VM-based hosting to containers.
- Automate Dockerfile generation for CI/CD pipelines.

##### Quick Syntax
```sh
az webapp generate-deployment-script --docker
``````
##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You have a .NET 6 app and need a Dockerfile for deployment to Azure Kubernetes
      Service (AKS). This command generates the Dockerfile, saving time and effort.

__How It Works:__
1. Scan the Project: Detects runtime and dependencies.
2. Generate Dockerfile: Creates a Dockerfile tailored to the app.
3. Customize: Modify the file for additional configurations.


__Procedure__:
```bash
# navigate to project
cd /path/to/project

# Generate Docker File
az webapp generate-deployment-script --docker

# Test dockerfile by building and deploying the app locally
docker build -t myapp . 
docker run -p 8080:80 myapp
```
