1) open WSL2 linux instance, and verify existing data instance 
2) open regedit 
          
          cmd:             
                                     windowsKey - r 
                                     regedit

                                 â€¢ registry entry we are looking for : 

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss


3) Find the linux distribution under the registry path
4) Click basepath to get the path to the virtual drive 
5) use path to navigate to virtual drive
