<h1>Software Procedure: Containerizing Angular Application </h1>
</center>


### Purpose
Create a secure, minimal, and production-ready Dockerfile to build and serve
an Angular application using a multi-stage build process.

### Prerequisites
- Installed Docker (v20.x or later).
- Node.js environment for Angular CLI (`node:20` or latest).
- An Angular application already set up (`ng build` ready).
- Basic permissions to run Docker commands.

### Steps
- We are going to create a Multi-Stage Dockerfile
- We are also going to use a lightweight linux server to serve it

1. **Step 1**: Build the application with node.js
   ```dockerfile
   # Add node runtime env and alias it AS "build"
   FROM node:20 AS build

   # (Optional: Create the directory you want to work from)
   # - optional because you can do the same with WORKDIR
   RUN mkdir /app

   # Set a new working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy over the dependencies json file to the working directory
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies (ci=clean-install.  Using instead of npm install)
   RUN npm ci

   # install angular cli
   RUN npm install @angular-cli

   # Copy over the rest of the application files (root to root)
   COPY . .

   # Build the project for production
   RUN npm run build --configuration=production
   ```
   - note: Docker caches each instruction so the artifacts of each instruction
           are all cached for use with other instructions


2. **Step 2**: Serve the application using NGINX and Alpine Linux
    ```Dockerfile
    # Get the NGINX-alpine image
    FROM nginx:alpine
  
    #NOTE: nginx may no longer support ---------------------
    # Make sure we change the root user to something else for security
    RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

    # Set the user
    USER appuser

    #NOTE ----------------------------------------------------

    # Change working directory to nginx webserver file
    WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

    # Copy artifacts from cache into its own directory withing above workdir
    # dist is the folder created when you build, browser contains the files we need
    #   to serve
    COPY --from=build /app/dist/[application-name]/browser/ .

    # Execute the Angular Application and WebServer
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    ```

  - note: Some instructions may have you `EXPOSE` a port, this is not recommended
          practice. See below for running the container to map the ports
  - By default: nginx exposes port 80


3. **Step 3**: Dockerfile should look like this
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:20 AS build #or later 
    RUN mkdir /app/code 
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY ./package*.json ./
    RUN npm ci
    RUN npm install -g @angular-cli
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build --prod

    # Deploy with NGINX
    FROM nginx:alpine
    # may not be supported
    RUN addgroup -S node && adduser -S node -G node
    USER node
    # --------------------
    WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
    COPY ./nginx.config ./etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    COPY --from=build /app/dist/[application-name]/browser .
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    ```

4. **Step 4**: (Optional) Create nginx.conf file at root of project
   - Allows us configuration control of nginx
![[Pasted image 20250107234400.png|400]]


   - then modify the nginx portion of the Dockerfile with the following line
    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./nginx.config ./etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ```
    
5. **Step 5**: Build Docker Image using the Dockerfile just created
     ```bash
     # build the docker image
     docker build -t [image-tag-name]

     # verify its built
     docker images
     ```

- build should look like this:
![[Pasted image 20250107214931.png]]

- Image should show up like this
![[Pasted image 20250107215102.png]]


6. **Step 6**: Test run the image in a container
     ```bash
     docker run --init --rm --publish 4200:80 [image-name]
     ```


### Expected Outcome
- Angular web server should be running on localhost:4200 and files should be
  served

- We created a successful docker image

### Troubleshooting


### Additional Notes
- Any extra tips, warnings, or links to resources.
