<h1>Feature: Dockerfiles</h1>
</center>


##### Syntax Description
A Dockerfile is a text file with a series of commands that Docker uses to
build an image. It defines the base image, dependencies, configuration, and
the command to run your app.

##### Use Case
Dockerfile are used to create images for applications, ensuring consistency
in how they run across environments like development, testing, and production.

##### Basic Syntax
- **Dockerfile structure**:
  - `FROM`: Base image for your container.
  - `WORKDIR`: Set the working directory in the container.
  - `COPY`/`ADD`: Copy files into the container.
  - `RUN`: Execute a command during the build process.
  - `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`: Define the default command to run the container.


##### Options 
---

| Command               | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `FROM`               | Sets the base image.                         |
| `WORKDIR`            | Sets the working directory for commands.     |
| `COPY`/`ADD`         | Copies files or directories into the image.  |
| `RUN`                | Runs commands during the build process.      |
| `CMD`                | Default command to run when container starts.|
| `ENTRYPOINT`         | Main executable in the container.            |
| `EXPOSE`             | Declares the container's network port.       |
| `ENV`                | Sets environment variables.                  |
| `ARG`                | Defines build-time variables.                |
| `LABEL`              | Adds metadata (e.g., author info).           |
| `VOLUME`             | Creates a mount point for storage.           |
| `USER`               | Sets the user to run commands in the container.|
| `ONBUILD`            | Triggers for images built from this one.     |
| `HEALTHCHECK`        | Checks if the container is healthy.          |
| `SHELL`              | Changes the default shell for commands.      |

##### Scenario:
>       You have a Node.js app that needs dependencies installed and should
>       run consistently in any environment. A Dockerfile automates setting
>       up the environment and ensures the app runs the same everywhere."

  __How To Implement:__
  - Create a `Dockerfile` in your app directory.
  - Add instructions like base image, dependencies, and commands.

  __Practical Example:__
```bash
# Dockerfile example for a Node.js app
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

  <h2>Writing Your Docker File</h2>
  <hr>
</center>

### Purpose
This file outlines how a container will be built. Each line is a new directive
of how to change your docker container

### Additional Notes
- You should think of your containers as `cattle, not pets`

- Remember, Docker containers are supposed to be disposable. Create them then 
  throw them away.

- Each line is an instruction to change the Docker container (adding whats called
  a `layer`)

### Prerequisites
- List any software, hardware, or permissions required.
- Include version numbers or configurations if applicable.

### Most basic Dockerfile
---
```Dockerfile
# Start with the node container
FROM node:20

# Run the following command
CMD ["node", "-e", "console.log(\"hi lol\")"]
```
- `FROM node:20`: means start with the NODE container
                (container comes from another dockerfile)

- `CMD` :  Can only have ONE of these in a docker file, adding more and docker
         will only use the last one
         - this is what you want docker to do when someone runs the container

  <h2>Writing Production Ready Dockerfile</h2>
  <hr>
</center>

- Lets see how to build a basic node.js (javascript) dockerfile that is 
  closer to production ready. 

1. **Step 1**: Set the base image
   - Choose the starting point for your container
    - OS
    - Runtime Environment (eg. node.js)
   - Use the most stable version of your base image
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:16.2.0
     ```

2. **Step 2**: Set the working directory
   - Define the directory where commands will run to keep container organized
     ```dockerfile
     WORKDIR /app
     ```

3. **Step 3**: Copy Dependency Files First
    - dependency files list the libraries and packages the project needs
        - node_modules, build.gradle, requirements, package.json, etc
    - Docker caches each instruction, so doing this first means you do not need
      to cache the dependencies again when running commands. 
     ```Dockerfile
     COPY project*.json ./
     ```

4. **Step 4**: Install Dependencies
   - Just like above, modify your container by going ahead and installing those 
     dependencie
     ```Dockerfile
     RUN npm install
     ```

5. **Step 5**: Copy the application code after installing dependencies
    - Copy the rest of the application files into the container
     ```Dockerfile
     COPY . .
     ```

6. **Step 6**: Build the application
    - Perform this step if you application needs a build step
     ```Dockerfile
     RUN npm run build
     ```

7. **Step 7**: Use Multi-Step Builds
   - After building the application, create a seperate final image build step
      using the artifacts of the application build step (remember Docker caches
      each instruction ran before this one so you can reuse that step)
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM nginx:alpine
     COPY --from-build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

     # Setup non-root User (improve security)
     RUN addgroup -s app && adduser -S app -G app
     USER app

     #  Expose a port (port you want to use for the app)
     EXPOSE 88

     # Implement HealthCheck
     HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout-5s CMD curl --fail http://localhost:80 || \
     exit 1

      # Setup Startup command (start the container command)
     CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

     # Minimize installed Packages
     RUN apt-get updates && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
     ```

- After your dockerfile is created, you can [build docker Image](devops/docker/1735905322-CKHQ.md)
