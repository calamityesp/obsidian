##### __Feature Description__
Docker is a tool that helps developers package their apps with everything they
need (code, tools, and settings) so they can run anywhere—on your laptop, 
a server, or in the cloud—without worrying about compatibility.

##### Use Case
- **Consistent Environments**: Avoid "works on my machine" issues.
- **Microservices**: Run multiple services (frontend, backend, database) in separate containers.
- **Quick Sharing**: Easily share your app with a team or deploy to servers.
- **Testing**: Test your app in clean environments or with different configurations.
- **Scaling**: Quickly run multiple copies of your app when needed.
- **Old Apps**: Run older apps in containers without affecting other software.

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You’re building a project with a website, backend, and database. Docker 
      lets you package and run each part in its own container, so it works the
      same on any computer or server.

__How It Works:__
Docker uses "Dockerfiles" to build containers. Each container includes
everything your app needs and runs in isolation. You can also use Docker
Compose to manage multiple containers.

__Practical Example:__
1. **Scenario:**  
   Run a website and database together with minimal setup.

2. **Steps:**
   - Write a **Dockerfile** for the website:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN npm install
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```
   - Write a **docker-compose.yml** to link the website and database:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'
     services:
       website:
         build: .
         ports:
           - "3000:3000"
       database:
         image: mongo
         ports:
           - "27017:27017"
     ```
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Access the website at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Outcome:**  
   Both the website and database run in their containers without manual configuration.
