<h1>Docker Containers</h1>
</center>


##### __Feature Description__
Docker containers are like tiny, portable computers that hold your app and 
everything it needs to run, such as code, libraries, and settings. They ensure
your app works the same no matter where it’s running.


##### Use Case
- Run apps in isolated environments without affecting the host system.
- Quickly test or deploy apps.
- Share a working app setup with a team.
- Scale apps easily by running multiple containers.

##### Example of When to Use

    Scenario:
      You have a Python app with specific libraries. Instead of installing
      those libraries on every system, you package the app in a container.
      This ensures it runs the same on your computer, a server, or in the cloud.


__How It Works:__
A Docker container is created from an image. The image acts as a blueprint,
and the container is the running instance of that image. Docker Engine manages
the container's lifecycle (start, stop, delete, etc.).

__Practical Example:__
```bash
#build the app
docker build -t my-app

#deploy the app to a docker container
docker run -p 8080:80 my-app
```

#### Crafting Containers by Hand
---
Here we are going to craft a Container from scratch to learn how containers 
work. 

This is often referred to as `Bare Metal` because you are building the service
from scratch with bare minimal prebuilt services

What we are going to do: 
- Download a docker ubuntu image to run in a local container 
- Inside of that new container, we will create a few new directories representing
  new roots (or containers)
- Using these new roots we will use `chroot` to create "containers" out of 
  those new directories we created earlier.

##### Change Root (charoot)
- In a container use case, this just sets the root directory of a process.
- anything out side of that roots scope will will not be accessible by the 
  process if its not in the roots path

1) Create a docker Ubuntu container 
-  We will run a docker container, and use it to hand craft other containers
```bash
docker run -it --name docker-host --rm --privileged ubuntu:jammy
```

2) Create a new directory called `my-new-root` once the docker image is running
```bash 
mkdir my-new-root
```

3) Add bash to your new container
```bash
# check to see the dependencies bash currently relies on 
ldd /bin/bash

# copy those libraries to their respective folders in your new container
# directories
cp /path/to/lib my-new-root/path/to/lib      

#note: its not necessary to add sub paths of the libs, but it wont hurt

# create a bin directoryu in your new root 
mkdir my-new-root/bin

# cp bash to the bin directory
cp /bin/bash my-new-root/bin/
```
4) repeat the above steps for adding all of the tools you need to get your 
   new container in tip top shape
eg. add ls, ps, cd, etc. very in efficient I know

5) Run your new container
```bash
# change root, then  run bash from your new root
chroot my-new-root bash

# this will now run bash in a "jailed" environment
```

#### Namespaces
---

##### What Are Namespaces?
Namespaces in Linux are like virtual walls that separate parts of the operating
system for a process. They make a process feel like it has its own mini
operating system, even though it's sharing resources with others.

##### What Namespaces Do:
- **Isolation**:  They hide parts of the system (like files, processes, or
              networks) from a process and give it a private view of those things.
- **Use Case**: Makes a process think it's the only thing running on the system.

##### Why They're Useful:
1. **Isolation**: Keep apps separate so they don’t interfere with each other.
2. **Security**: Stops one app from accessing or affecting another app’s data.
3. **Custom Environments**: Create unique setups for testing or running apps.

##### Types of Namespaces:
| Namespace         | What It Does                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **PID Namespace**  | Controls what processes a program can see (its own tree).|
| **Mount Namespace**| Lets a program see its own version of the filesystem.    |
| **Network Namespace** | Gives a program its own network setup (e.g., IPs).    |
| **UTS Namespace**  | Allows a program to have its own hostname/domain name.   |
| **IPC Namespace**  | Isolates inter-process communication (like shared memory).|
| **User Namespace** | Gives a program its own user and group IDs.              |
| **Cgroup Namespace** | Isolates system resource controls (CPU, memory, etc.). |

##### Real-Life Example:
Imagine a large building (your computer) with multiple apartments (namespaces):
- Each apartment has its own kitchen, bathroom, and living room (resources).
- If you’re in one apartment, you can’t see or access another apartment, even though they’re all in the same building.

---

##### How Namespaces Work Together:
Linux uses namespaces to build **containers**:
- A container combines namespaces to make an app feel like it has its own OS.
- It's all running on the same system, but with namespaces, everything feels isolated.

---

**Summary:** Namespaces make processes feel like they’re in their own little
          world, even though they share the same system underneath.
