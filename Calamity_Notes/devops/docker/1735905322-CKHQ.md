<h1>Docker Images</h1>
</center>


#### Feature Description
A Docker image is like a recipe for a container. It includes all the
instructions, code, and files needed to create and run an app.

#### Laymen's Terms Description
Think of image as a container itself. Pretty much it. You create a Dockerfile
and you build your project using the Dockerfile and you create your container as
an image

#### Use Case
- Create a reusable blueprint for containers.
- Share apps with a team or deploy them anywhere.
- Store specific versions of an app for consistency.

####  Laymen's Use Case


#### Quick Syntax
```bash
# create your image
docker build -t my-image-name

# list the images
docker images

# remove images
docker rmi my-image
```

---
#### Scenario:

>    Youâ€™ve developed a web app and need to share it with your team. Instead of
>    sending a bunch of files and setup instructions, you build a Docker image that
>    bundles everything. Your team uses the image to run the app exactly as you
>    intended.

-  __How It Works:__
    A Docker image is a file that contains all the parts of an app (code,
    libraries, tools, and configurations). When you use the image, Docker creates
    a container that runs based on the image.

- __Practical Example:__

```bash
# Step 1: Write a Dockerfile (assuming you are in the project directory)
cat <<EOF > Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
EOF

# Step 2: Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-web-app .

# Step 3: Run a container from the built image
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-web-app

# Step 4: Access your app
# Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
```

### Addiontal Built Reference
---
- this section just gives some additional commands you can use with docker build

  > The [repository[:tag]] option in Docker is the name of an image and its
  > optional version (tag). It helps you find or work with specific images.

```bash
# List the specific image with a tag
  docker images nginx:latest

# Pull an image with a specific tag
  docker pull nginx:latest

# Remove an image with a specific tag
  docker rmi nginx:latest
  ```

  >The name[:tag|@digest] option in Docker is used to specify an image by its
  >name, and optionally by its version (tag) or unique identifier (digest).
  
```bash
#using tag
  docker pull nginx:1.21

#using digest
  docker pull nginx@sha256:12345abcdef6789
```

<h1>Software Procedure: Creating Docker Image </h1>
</center>


## Purpose
This procedure explains how to create a Docker image to package an application
with all its dependencies for consistent deployment.

## Prerequisites
 Docker installed (version 20.x or later).
- A project directory with application code.
- A basic understanding of the terminal or command line.
- Permissions to run Docker commands on your system.

## Steps
---
1.  **Step 1**: Write a Dockerfile
    - View more about dockerfiles [here](devops/docker/1736033638-GAFJ.md)
    - Example:

```dockerfiles
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2.  **Step 2**: Build the Docker Image
    - `-t my_app`: Assigns the name "my_app" to the image
    - `.`:  Specifes current directory, but you can change this to the working directory you have the docker file
    - Example:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my_app .
    ```

3.  **Step 3**: Verify the docker image was created
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

4.  **Step 4**: Test the Docker Image
    - Run a container to check if the image works
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 my_app
    ```

5. **Step 5**: Tag the image (optional)
   - Add a version tag to the image for better version control
     ```bash
     docker tag my_app my_app:1.0
     ```

6. **Step 6**: Push the image to a Docker Registry (Optional)
   - Share the image by uploading it to a registry (Like Docker hub, or private)
     ```bash
     docker login
     docker tag my_app my-dockerhub-user/my-app:1.0
     docker push my-dockerhub-user/my_app:1.0
     ```

7. **Step 7**: Clean up unused images (optional)
   - Remove unused or dangling images and free up space
     ```bash
     docker image prune
     ```

---

## Expected Outcome
- A Docker image is successfully built and stored locally.
- The image is listed when you run `docker images`.
- The image can be used to create and run containers.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: `Cannot locate Dockerfile`.
  **Solution**: Ensure the Dockerfile is in the build context or specify its location with `-f`.  
  Example:
  ```bash
  docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile -t my-image .
  ```

## Additional Notes
- Use meaningful tags (-t) to track different versions of your image.
- For faster builds, minimize layers in your Dockerfile.
- Test your image by running it with docker run before pushing it to a registry.
- Reference Docker's official build documentation for advanced options.
