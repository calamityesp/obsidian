#### Obsidian Note Link (Markdown)
---

- Link to note
```text
This is a note [[My Note]]
```

- This is a header in my note
```text
[[Note Name#Header Name]]
```

- This is a bullet from my note (make block id from a markdown bullet using html div)
 - you need to use html to add a block id because its not supported in markdown directly
```text
[[Note Name#^block-id]]

eg. - <div id="example-bullet">This is a bullet with an ID</div>
```


note, you can use html elements to target linking
