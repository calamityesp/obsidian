__Windows to WSL__

We will port forward port 2000 from windows to wsl 

1) Open Powershell in Terminal/Shell on Windows as administrator

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=2000 `
connectaddress=$($(wsl hostname -I ).Trim());
```
- netsh - commandline utility in windows that allow you to manage network configurations
  - portproxy add  - adds a new port forwarding rule
  - v4tov4         - Specifies forwarding between ipv4
  - listenport     - the port on local machine where it listens for incoming traffic
  - listenaddress  - the address to listen on (0.0.0.0 = all network interfaces)
  - connectport    - port on target machine where traffic is forwarded
  - connectaddress - ip address if the wsl instance (use wsl to get that innformation)



2) Verify all of your forwards that you have setup
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4
```


3) if you want to delete a portforward (replace values as needed)
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2000
```
