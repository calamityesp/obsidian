#### Port Forwarding From Windows To Wsl
---

1) Open Terminal/Command Line in Administrator Mode   (powershell)


2) Run the following command
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=2000 `
connectaddress=$($(wsl hostname -I).Trim());
```
- `netsh iterface portproxy add v4tov4`    - this commands starts the command to add a ipv4 to ipv4 forwarding
- `listenport=2000`                        - Host machine port you are connecting the remote port to
- `listenaddress=0.0.0.0`                  - Ip Address on host machine we will listen from
- ` `                                      - 0.0.0.0 indicates it will listen from all network adapters
- `connectport=2000`                       - remote port that we want to connect listening port to
- `connectaddress`                         - Ip Address to the remote wsl machine we are connecting to
- ` `                                      - Note - we are using variable to get hostname for wsl here


3) Verify that the Forwarding is working
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4
```

---
#### Remove a port forward
---
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2000
```
