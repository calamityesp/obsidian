ðŸ“Œ How should we approach writting our css

When writing css it is a good practice to make sure we structure our css in a 
way that maintanable

#### Writing Maintainable CSS
There are alot of naming conventions, tooling, and frameworks out there to 
make writing and maintaing CSS easier. 

Working on solo projects, decide your convention and stick to it. In a team
setting, you will follow the conventions of the team of course. 

#### Utility-first vs "traditional" methods

utility classes (thanks to `tailwind`) are very popular compared to olders
conventions like `BEM`
- Caution: not recommended to use utility classes when doing a vanilla js project
           utility classes are most useful if creating reusable components
-   If you not using a js framework, utility classes just makes no sense since you 
    will be repeating things too much.. Changes become a nightmare

#### Dont be dogmatic
Keep an open mind and recognize that there may be a "right way" for you but it 
may not be a right way for everyone

Be open minded and try different approaches

#### Finding a balance
Use the right tool for the job.. Sometimes it makes sense to use Utility Classes
sometimes it doesn't

Find a balance for what feels right
