<h1>ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED</h1>
</center>

ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED, is related to Node.js's OpenSSL configuration. This issue typically arises due to changes in 
OpenSSL versions, specifically with the introduction of OpenSSL 3.0, which deprecates some algorithms and introduces 
stricter security policies. Node.js versions prior to v17.0.0 do not fully support OpenSSL 3.0, leading to errors when 
trying to use cryptographic functions.


If you must use legacy openssl, you will need to add env variable enabling it in your .bashrc (or shell configuration)
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```


Additionally you can make sure you are using the lts (long term support version of node)
```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```
