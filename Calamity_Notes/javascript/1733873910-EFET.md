#### Overview
---

- Used in reactive/declarative coding and RxJS

- Observables are a special type of promise
> - Observables can often times be used interchangeably with promises

- Think Of  Observables as follows:
> - Promises that do not go away after they have executed their call back, but can continue to 
>   provide

##### How to use Observables

Example of an Observable: 
```javascript
myMethod(){
  this.name = 'Name not yet set'


  getuserName().subscribe((name) => {
    this.name = name;
    displayUsersName();
  })
}
```
>>> - We can Assume that `displayUsersName()` returns an observable object

- You need to subscribe your observable and the call back is really a subscriber handler
