#### Installing Eslint
---

Even if you have the eslint library installed in neovim, you will still need to install eslint localling
in your project (recommended, or you can set it up globally)

This is the best way to do it
```bash
      npm init @eslint/config@latest
```


###### Run Eslint on your files manually
\---------------------------------------

You can use the following command to run eslint on your files manually
```bash
      npx eslint yourfile.js   #no need in using yarn.. dont do it unless you have to
```
