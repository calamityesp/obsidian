#### Creating a next.js project
---

We can create a new next js project using the following command:

for automatic installation:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

for manual installation:
```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

---
#### Run the build
---

you can run the build by looking in the package.json file:
```json
{
  "name": "nextauth",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "next": "14.2.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "postcss": "^8",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.2.5"
  }
}
```
here you can see dev, build, start, lint. 
run the following to run the application: 
```bash
npm run dev
```
