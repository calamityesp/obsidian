#### Http
---

Here is the http lifetime:
1. Communication Starts
2. Client sends a request to the server
3. Server recieves the request
4. Server does something with the request, like executing code/logic
5. Server responds to the client
6. Communication ends

Http is stateless
  - however http can use cookies to create some kind of persistance

Here is an example of a get request:
```javascript

```
