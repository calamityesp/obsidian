There are two parts:
1) App builder and configuration part 
  - register services, and build the application with the `builder.Build()` command

2) Request pipeline
  - After `builder.Build`
  - calls to `Use`
    \- "Use" adds middleware components to asp.net middleware pipeline
    \- uses `next` delegate (function pointer) to send the request through each of the 
     middleware services

#### App Builder and Configuration

WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)
\----------------------------------------
- Class introduced in .net 6 to simplify creation and configuration of asp.net core web applications
- acts as main entry point for building, configuring the web application
- simplifies the older startup and program class structures of pre .net 6 web applications
