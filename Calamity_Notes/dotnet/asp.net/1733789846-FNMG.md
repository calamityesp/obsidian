#OVERVIEW
---
#### (Overview) - Why use Entity Framework Core
---

- Entity framework is an ORM (object relational map) and one of the best on the market

- It allows you to do `Code First` development (define your schema with .net classes then
  use the classes to generate your database tables)

- Query Abstraction - (use `linQ`) powerful and flexiible quesry abstraction layer so developers can 
  write database queries in an expansive way. Simplifying the process of database interaction

- Change Tracking - built in tracking to help manage changes to data iin memory and synchronize
  them to the database

- Database Migrations - Allows developers to modify database schemas incrementally. synchronizes
  updating database in a version-controlled manner

#### How does Ef Core Work in code
---

` DbContext`:   - Main class of EF Core.
              - Represents a databse sessioni
              - Manages connection to the database (If you have a database, think DbContext for it)
               - also manages database queries, and execution of database commands

`DbSet`       - Represents Collection of entities in the database
            - Proviides methods for queryingand manipulating the corresponding database table

#### Example
---
```cs
// create  dbcontext / database session class
public class EmployeeDbContext : DbContext
{
  // create a DbSet / Employee table based off the Emplopyee  model
  public  DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
}
```
Now you can use the DbSet and LINQ to query the database table
```cs
var employee = Context
    .Employees
    .Where(e => e.Department == "Salesa")
    .ToList();
```
this will translate roughly to the followinging sql query
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHEREE Department = "Sales";
```
