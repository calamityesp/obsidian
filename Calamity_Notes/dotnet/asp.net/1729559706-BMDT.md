##### 1) How does asp.net core work?
![[Pasted image 20241021200243.png]]

- User starts by requesting a web page
- Request is sent to a web server
- server interprets the http request to be and generates html 
- sends the html back in the HTTP response, then browser can display the web page
    - A response can be a web page, a javascript file, a http response, an image, etc

definitions: 
hostname    :    how the website uniquely identifies its location on the internet via DNS mapping
dns         :    Domain Name Service to an IP address (e.g microsoft.com, www.google.com) <- gets mapped to ip address

1.4.2) How does ASP.NET Core process a request?
-  browsers still use the same HTTP protocol as before to communicate with asp.net application
      - asp.net core itself encompasses everything that is used to handle the request, including validation, and etc.

- Kestrel is by default the built-in web server responsible for receiving raw requests and constructing an internal 
  representation of data   `HttpContext`
  - application can use the details stored in the `HttpContext` to generate appropriate repsponse to the request. 
    - such as: return "access denied" , send an email, or whatever the application requirements are
- After application processes the requests, it will return the response to Kestral (or the web server)
