#### Installing SDK && runtime (Ubuntu)
---
-   You need both the sdk and the runtime if you want to develop with dotnet
Fetch the dotnet sdk using the following command in terminal:
```
        sudo apt-get update && \
          sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

-   Now you need to install the runtime
```
        sudo apt-get update && \
          sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-8.0
```
