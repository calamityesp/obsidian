### Introduction
Bash scripting is a way to automate tasks in Linux/Unix systems. It uses the
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) language to create scripts that can execute commands,
process files, and manage system operations. Scripts start with #!/bin/bash
(shebang) and can be run after making them executable with chmod +x. Bash
scripts are powerful for task automation, system administration, and running
multiple commands in sequence.

__Key features__:
- Variables and control flow
- File operations
- Command execution
- Text processing
- System administration tasks


### Guidlines to writing scripts

2. Shebang (#!/bin/bash) (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
3. Script description comment
4. Define variables
5. Define functions (if needed)
6. Main script logic
7. Error handling
8. Exit with status code

__example__
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple script to backup files
# Usage: ./backup.sh <source_directory>

# Variables
SOURCE_DIR=$1
BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/backup"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Main logic
if [ -z "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Error: Source directory not specified"
    exit 1
fi

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.tar.gz" "$SOURCE_DIR"

exit 0
```
