# Tables
**How it works:** Tables store structured data in rows and columns. Each table 
               has a schema defining its structure (columns, data types, etc.).
**How/When to use:** Use tables to organize and persist data for your 
                 application or system. Example: storing employee information.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

# Views
**How it works:** Views are virtual tables created using SQL queries. They 
                  don't store data but fetch it dynamically from the underlying
                  tables.
**How/When to use:** Use views to simplify complex queries or restrict access
                     to specific data. Example: filtering active users.
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_employees AS
SELECT id, name, department
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active';
```

---

# Indexes
**How it works:** Indexes create a data structure (like a B-tree) that allows 
                  quick access to rows based on indexed columns.
**How/When to use:** Use indexes on frequently queried columns to improve query
                     performance. Avoid over-indexing to prevent performance 
                     issues during inserts/updates.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);
```

---

# Stored Procedures
**How it works:** Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code blocks stored in 
                  the database that can perform operations or return results.
**How/When to use:** Use for repetitive tasks like data processing or batch 
                     updates. Example: calculating and updating monthly reports
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment @departmentId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON; -- Prevent extra result sets for better performance

    SELECT 
        id, 
        name, 
        position, 
        salary 
    FROM 
        employees WITH (NOLOCK) -- Avoid blocking and locking issues
    WHERE 
        department_id = @departmentId
    ORDER BY 
        name; -- Optimize for sorting with indexed columns
END;
```

---

# Functions (UDFs)
**How it works:** Functions take inputs, perform operations, and return a value. They can be scalar (single value) or table-valued.  
**How/When to use:** Use for calculations, data transformations, or reusable logic in queries. Example: formatting names.  

---

# Triggers
**How it works:** Triggers automatically execute predefined SQL code in response to table events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  
**How/When to use:** Use to enforce business rules or audit changes. Example: logging updates to critical tables.  

---

# Sequences
**How it works:** Sequences generate unique numeric values, often used for primary keys.  
**How/When to use:** Use when you need unique IDs independent of table operations. Example: order numbers.  

---

# Schemas
**How it works:** Schemas logically group database objects, providing organization and access control.  
**How/When to use:** Use schemas to separate and manage objects by purpose or ownership. Example: grouping HR-related tables.  

---

# Constraints
**How it works:** Constraints enforce rules on data, such as uniqueness, relationships, or valid ranges.  
**How/When to use:** Use to maintain data integrity. Example: foreign key constraints for relational data.  

---

# Synonyms
**How it works:** Synonyms create aliases for database objects to simplify references.  
**How/When to use:** Use for simplifying object names or managing cross-database access. Example: aliasing a remote table.  

---

# Materialized Views
**How it works:** Materialized views store query results physically for fast access.  
**How/When to use:** Use for complex queries where performance is critical. Example: precomputing sales summaries.  

---

# Cursors
**How it works:** Cursors iterate through query results row-by-row, allowing procedural logic to process each row.  
**How/When to use:** Use when row-level operations are required. Example: updating rows based on custom logic.  

---

# Partitions
**How it works:** Partitions split large tables into smaller, manageable pieces based on a column (e.g., date).  
**How/When to use:** Use for large datasets to improve performance and manageability. Example: partitioning logs by month.  

---

# Roles and Users
**How it works:** Roles and users control database access and permissions. Roles group privileges for easier management.  
**How/When to use:** Use to enforce security and manage access. Example: granting read-only access to analysts.
