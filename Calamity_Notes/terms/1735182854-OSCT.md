##### Use:
Azure Devops Pipelines

##### Short Description:
Phases in Azure DevOps pipelines define when elements like parameters,
variables, and steps are processed (e.g., parsing, queue, runtime).

##### Long Description:
Azure DevOps pipelines operate in distinct phases:

Template Parsing Time: Processes parameters, expands templates, and resolves
${{ expressions }} before pipeline execution starts. This ensures the pipeline
structure is fully defined.
-   `Queue Time`: Allows passing parameter values when triggering a pipeline,
    overriding defaults.

-   `Runtime`: Executes the pipeline steps and tasks. Variables like 
    $(VariableName) are resolved during this phase.

-   `Compile Time`: Combines templates, parameters, and defaults to build the
    final pipeline YAML, applicable in multi-template scenarios.
