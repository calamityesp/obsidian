##### Use:
Bash Command (linux)

##### Short Description:
    A label is a name you give to a saved secret so you can recognize it
    easily later, like naming a folder on your computer.

##### Long Description:
    A label in secret-tool is a human-readable name for the stored secret.
    It helps identify and describe the secret in the keyring, making it easier
    to manage and recognize (e.g., "MyApp API Token"). Labels do not affect
    retrieval, which relies on key-value pairs.

    Example:
        When storing a password for "MyApp," you can use a label like this:
            ```secret-tool store --label="MyApp Password" key myapp```
            This makes it easy to identify as the password for "MyApp."
