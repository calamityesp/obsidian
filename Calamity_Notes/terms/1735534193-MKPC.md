##### Use:
Define Environment (system) variables to set specific configuration variables
based on application needs

##### Example:
```bash
# Setting an environment variable
export ENVIRONMENT=staging

# Accessing the variable
echo $ENVIRONMENT
```

##### Short Description:
An environment is like a setup or workspace for your app, controlled by
settings like environment variables (e.g., dev, staging, production).

##### Long Description:
In Linux, environments are controlled by variables (like ENVIRONMENT or
DATABASE_URL) that tell your app how to act. For example:

-   In development, it might use a test database.
-   In production, it might use a live database. You set these variables using
    export and check them with echo. Itâ€™s a quick way to change how your app
    behaves without changing the code.
