### **Installing golang on Linux
---

##### Basic Installation Instruction
\---------------------------

1) Remove previous installation

    ` rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz`

-   <bold>DO NOT</bold> untar the archive into existing /usr/local/go tree

2) Add /usr/local/go/bin to env path

    `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`

3) Verify installation 

    `go version`


###### ASDF installation instruction

### Writing some code in Go 
---
- Lets write a simple hello world app

1. Navigate to directory you want to create your go application / source code
2. Create a folder with your project name and change directories into it (cd)
		`mkdir <project name>`
		`cd <project name>`

3. Enable dependency tracking for code
	- When you import packages contained in other modules, your code tracks these dependencies using its own module which is defined by `go.mod` 
	  file that is created when you initialize your go code. This file stays with the code and is included with the source code repository

	- In production/development, the module path for your projects is the repository location where this source code is kept (aka, the directory you created in the second step in our case)
		- If we plan to push this to a GitHub repo, then we will set the module path to the GitHub URL to the module. For example: 
				`github.com/calamityesp/<project name>`
		- reason for this is because we want to set the module path to a place where GOLANG tools can download the module. If we want to keep this project local then we can just set the path to the directory path
				`/home/calamity/projects/<project name>`
