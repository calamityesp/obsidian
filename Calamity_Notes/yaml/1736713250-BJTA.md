##### Syntax Description
Comments in YAML are lines or parts of a line that start with a `#`. They are
ignored during parsing and used to explain or annotate the file.

##### Use Case
- Documenting complex configurations.
- Explaining key-value pairs or lists.
- Temporarily disabling settings.
- Adding reminders or notes for collaborators.
- Clarifying nested data structures.

##### Basic Syntax
```YAML
# this is a full-line comment
key: value      # this is a inline comment
```
