<h1>Bitwise "&" Operator</h1>
</center>


- The bitwise & operator compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand.
- If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0.

```python
a = 0b1100  # binary for 12
b = 0b1010  # binary for 10
      1000  
result = a & b  # result is 0b1000, binary for 8
print(result)  # Output: 8

```
