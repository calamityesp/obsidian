<h1>Bitwise "or" Operator</h1>
</center>

- The bitwise | (OR) operator compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand.
- If at least one of the bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.


```python
a = 0b1100  # binary for 12
b = 0b1010  # binary for 10
result = a | b  # result is 0b1110, binary for 14
print(result)  # Output: 14

```
