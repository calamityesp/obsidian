<h1>Counting Sort</h1>
</center>


### Purpose
Sort an array in linear time by counting occurrences of each distinct element.

### Use Case
- Sorting arrays of integers with a small, known range.
- Organizing scores or ratings in educational or survey data.
- Preparing data for radix sort as a subroutine.
- Sorting keys in bucket-based algorithms.
- Counting frequency of discrete events in data analysis.

### Bad Case
- Large Range: Terrible if the range of values is much larger than the number of elements
- Non-Integer Data: Not suitable for complex non integer data
- Memory Usage: Requires additional memory proportional to the range of input values

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of arrays and loops

### How it works
1) `Find the range`: determine the minimal and maximum values in the array
2) `Initialize the Count Array`: Create array of 0s of length == range of input values
3) `Count Occurrences`: iterate over the main array, increment number of indexes
                      corresponding to each element
4) `Accumulate Counts`: Modify the count array so that each element stores the 
                      sum of previous counts
5) `Build Sorted Output`: Iterate the main array backwards, placing each element 
                        into its correct sorted position using the count array
                        , then decrement the count
6) `Copy Back`: If necessary , copy the sorted output back into original array

### Steps
---
1. **Step 1**: Validate Input
    - start by writing a function, check if the array is empty, return empty
      array if its empty
    ```python
    def count_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) == 0:
        return arr
    ```


---
2. **Step 2**: Determine the Range
    - calculate min and max values in the array
    - save them to variables
     ```python
         min_val, max_val = min(arr), max(arr)
     ```


---
3. **Step 3**: Initialize Count Array
    - use list multiplication to Initialize list in python
    ```python
    count_arr = [0] * (max_val - min_val + 1)
    ```


---
4. **Step 4**: Count Occurrences
    - Loop through each element in the input array
    - for each element, increment count_arr
     ```python
     for n in numArray:
       count_arr[n - min_val] += 1
     ```
Explanation: 
>For each number in the array, you adjust its value by subtracting the minimum
>value to find its correct index in the count array, then increment that index.
>This effectively counts how many times each number appears.
> eg.  9 - 6 = index: 3 for the 9 value if 6 is the lowest value

---


5. **Step 5**: Accumulate Counts
    - loop through count_arr starting from index 1
    - for each index i , update count_arr[i] to be count_arr[i] + count_arr[i-1]
     ```python
     # input (main array to see length): [3, 3, 6, 5, 7, 2, 3, 2, 6, 7, 9] 

     for c in range(1, len(count_arr)):
       count[c] = count[c] + count[c -1]

    # output: [2, 5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 10, 11]
     ```
Explanation:
> Think of each index in the count array as a "bucket" thats holding all of the
> numbers/values. The "count" stored in the count_arr represents how many items
> are in said bucket. In the new array, we need to know which index to start
> placing number/value from the bucket so that the items are together in the new
> array

---


6. **Step 6**: Build Sorted Output
    - create an output array of the same length as input array
    - iterate over the input array in reverse. For each element:
      1. decrement the corresponding cumulative count in count_arr
      2. use decrement value as index to place the element in the output array
     ```python
         for n in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        count_arr[arr[n] - min_val] -= 1
        output_arr[count_arr[arr[n] - min_val]] = arr[n]
     ```

7. **Step 7**:  The full count sort algorithm
      ```python
      numArray = [3, 3, 6, 5, 7, 2, 3, 2, 6, 7, 9]

      def count_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) == 0:
          return arr
          min_val, max_val = min(arr), max(arr)
          count_arr = [0] * (max_val - min_val + 1)
          output_arr = [0] * (len(arr))
          for n in arr:
            count_arr[n - min_val] += 1

          for c in range(1, len(count_arr)):
            count_arr[c] = count_arr[c] + count_arr[c - 1]

          for n in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
            count_arr[arr[n] - min_val] -= 1
            output_arr[count_arr[arr[n] - min_val]] = arr[n]

          return output_arr


      count_sort(numArray)
      ```

Ascii illistration of Count Sort
```yaml
Input Array: [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1]

Step 1: Count Occurrences
--------------------------------
Value:      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Count:      1   2   2   1   0   0   0   1

Step 2: Cumulative Count (Accumulated Counts)
-----------------------------------------------
Value:      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Count:      1   3   5   6   6   6   6   7

Step 3: Building the Sorted Output
-------------------------------------
Place each element using the cumulative counts:
Output Array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8]
```
