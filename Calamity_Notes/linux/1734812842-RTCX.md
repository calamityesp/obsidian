##### __Feature Description__
A keyring in Linux is a storage facility for securely managing passwords,
cryptographic keys, and other sensitive data. It helps centralize and protect
credentials for applications and services.


##### Use Case
Used for securely storing authentication credentials, such as passwords and
API keys, to avoid manually entering them each time.


##### Quick Commands
note: This assumes `secret-tool` was installed
```bash
secret-tool store --label="Example" mykey value "<key to store>"
secret-tool lookup mykey (Retrieve a key)
secret-tool clear mykey (Delete a key)
```
