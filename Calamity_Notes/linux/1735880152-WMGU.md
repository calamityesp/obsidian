##### What Are Namespaces?
Namespaces in Linux are like virtual walls that separate parts of the operating
system for a process. They make a process feel like it has its own mini
operating system, even though it's sharing resources with others.

##### What Namespaces Do:
- **Isolation**:  They hide parts of the system (like files, processes, or
              networks) from a process and give it a private view of those things.
- **Use Case**: Makes a process think it's the only thing running on the system.

##### Why They're Useful:
1. **Isolation**: Keep apps separate so they don’t interfere with each other.
2. **Security**: Stops one app from accessing or affecting another app’s data.
3. **Custom Environments**: Create unique setups for testing or running apps.

##### Types of Namespaces:
| Namespace         | What It Does                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **PID Namespace**  | Controls what processes a program can see (its own tree).|
| **Mount Namespace**| Lets a program see its own version of the filesystem.    |
| **Network Namespace** | Gives a program its own network setup (e.g., IPs).    |
| **UTS Namespace**  | Allows a program to have its own hostname/domain name.   |
| **IPC Namespace**  | Isolates inter-process communication (like shared memory).|
| **User Namespace** | Gives a program its own user and group IDs.              |
| **Cgroup Namespace** | Isolates system resource controls (CPU, memory, etc.). |

##### Real-Life Example:
Imagine a large building (your computer) with multiple apartments (namespaces):
- Each apartment has its own kitchen, bathroom, and living room (resources).
- If you’re in one apartment, you can’t see or access another apartment, even though they’re all in the same building.

---

##### How Namespaces Work Together:
Linux uses namespaces to build **containers**:
- A container combines namespaces to make an app feel like it has its own OS.
- It's all running on the same system, but with namespaces, everything feels isolated.

---

**Summary:** Namespaces make processes feel like they’re in their own little
          world, even though they share the same system underneath.

#### Using the `Unshare` For Namespaces
---

- `unshare` creates a process with specific namespaces

```bash
sudo unshare --pid --mount /bin/bash

#test 
ps -aux
```
- pid: isolates the process ids (starts a new process tree)
- mount: isolates filesystem mount points
- /bin/bash:  run bash inside of the new namespace

- you can use this in conjunction with chroot to create a container with its
  own namespace
