<h1>Archlinux - Setup Initial</h1>
</center>


### Purpose
Explain the purpose of this procedure in one or two sentences.

### Prerequisites


### PreInstallation Steps
1. **Step 1**:  Make sure to validate your iso, and create a bootable USB
    - [Archlinux Main](linux/arch/1737758270-IBGP.md) has information on where 
      to start with the initial creation

    - [(Arch) Validating Archlinux Image](linux/arch/1739142218-MXTM.md) shows
      how to validate the imate


### Installation Steps (From Live Disk)
---
1. **Step 1**: Configure Keyboard Layout and font size
   - Arch boots in console, we need to setup the console and keyboard keymap
   ```bash
   # search for locale keymaps if us is not the one you want
   localectl list-keymaps

   # set keymap (in this case to US)
   loadkeys us

   # change font size if you want (this doubles the fontsize of console)
   setfont -d

   # change the font (optional)
   # font location: cat /sys/firmware/
   setfont ter-132b
   ```

2. **Step 2**: Verify Boot Mode
     ```bash
     cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
     ```
    - Should return `64` meaning its booted in UEFI mode and is 64 bit
    - If returns `32` means that it has 32 bit mode. 
    - file doesnt exist, system may be booted into BIOS or CSM mode.


2. **Step 2**: Setup Internet connection
     ```bash
     # Check for network interface
     ip link
    ```

    - Following uses iwctl to setup and configure wireless network
    ```bash
     # Connect to wireless networh with iwctl
     # follow the prompts, following are all iwctl
     iwctl
     help                                             # to get help within iwctl
     device list                                      # list devices

     # if device is off, turn it on
     device [name] set-property Powered on
     devuce [adapter] set-property Powedered on      # use one of the other

     # scan for networks
     station [name] scan                            # this will not output anything
     station [name] get-networks                    # list available networks

     # connect to a network
     station [name] connect ssid                    # if there is a passphrase, put it in
     device [name] show                             # display device again
     station [name] show                            # display connection information 

     # to disconnect from network
     station [name] disconnect

     # exit iwctl
     quit
    ```

    - check if we made a connection
      `ping archlinux.org`

- learn more about [Arch iwctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl) 


3. **Step 3**: Update System Clock
    - `systemd-timesyncd` on live is enabled by default, check it its working
    ```bash
    timedatectl

4. **Step 4**: Partition the disks
   - Results ending in rom, loop, airootsfs may be ignored
   - mmcblk* devices ending in rpbm, boot0, boot1 can be ignored
     ```bash
     # Example command
     ```

    ```
