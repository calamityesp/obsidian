<h1>Angular Reactive Primitives</h1>

There are Three reactive primitives:

- Signal, Computed, Effect
  -  These are really 3 functions of react, but reactive primitives sounds cooler

---
#### Signal
---

\- Signals are a value that can tell Angular when to change
\- They are also capable of notifying its context of future changes in its value
    - it can do this because it knows where there are changes

The beauty of signals is that you do not need to check every component to look for changes, you can just emit a signal and 
refresh only that component that sent the signal. 

Example of Signal:
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <p> {{ lastname() }}, {{ firstname() }}</p>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstname = signal('Jessica');
  lastname = signal('Wesley');
}
```


---
#### Computed
---

You derive new value when one of the dependent signals change
- This is like the shopping cart on a website. WHen you add to the cart you get the total, when you change the list of items
  you want the total to change. 
- Computed lets you have an updated signal value based off other signal values

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `<p>{{ fullName }}</p>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstName = signal('Simona');
  lastName = signal('Cotin');
  fullName = computed(() => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`);
}
```

This emits a signal when firstname, or last name changes, and will only recalculate when there is a change. Essentially 
this will be performing memoization, and caching

You can use signals and computed anywhere in the application, not just in a component. 


---
#### Effect
---

Effect is how you can make a customized response to a signal change

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `<p>{{ fullName }}</p>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstName = signal('Simona');
  lastName = signal('Cotin');
  effect(() => console.log('Updated: ' + lastName()) )
}
```
- this is great for or for making an api call. Perform a behavior if an signal changes
