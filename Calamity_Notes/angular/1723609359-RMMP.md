#### Angular BootStrapping
---

When starting an angular application, angular doesn't look over every file
to figure out if there is a component that you need to add. For instance, if
you add a component to index.html file like this:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>FirstAngularApp</title>
  <base href="/">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root>
    <SomeCustomComponent></SomeCustomComponent>
  </app-root>
</body>
</html>
```
where SomeCustomComponent is the component you just made, well Angular doesn't 
know what that is. 

For Angular to gain the ability to know what the component is, it will start by 
bootstrapping your starting component (Usually: AppComponent by default)

In Main.ts:
```typescript
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```
Now Angular knows about AppComponent.. If we wanted, we could also bootstrap our
custom component like this: 
```typescript
// This code is written in main.ts

import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';
import { SomeCustomComponent } from './app/SomeCustomComponent.component'

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
bootstrapApplication(SomeCustomComponent).catch((err) => console.err(err)) 
```

Now Angular will know about SomeCustomComponent and can replace that tag in the
Index.html file. However, this is not typically how you want to render that component

###### How to render sub components
\-------------------------------------
In Angular, you want to build a tree of components: 
![[Pasted image 20240813223800.png|500]]

- the idea behind this is that components that are part of the same tree, or same application
  can work together and exchange data and communicate.

So the idea is that you will call the bootstrap component (just one) and branch off the other
components you want to launch
