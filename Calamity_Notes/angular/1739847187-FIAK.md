##### Syntax Description
RxJS is a library that helps track and respond to changing data, like user
clicks, API calls, or real-time updates, making async tasks easier to manage.

##### Use Case
- Handling async operations like API calls and events.
- Managing complex state and data streams in front-end frameworks.
- Implementing real-time updates and event-driven architectures.

##### Synopsis
RxJS provides Observable, operators, and subscriptions to handle asynchronous
data flow in a more structured way.

**Key Features:**

| **Feature**  | **Description**                                               |                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Observable   | Represents a stream of data that can be observed.             |                    |
| Observer     | Listens and reacts to data emitted by an Observable.          |                    |
| Subscription | Connects an Observer to an Observable.                        |                    |
| Operators    | Modify or transform data streams.                             |                    |
| Subjects     | Multicast Observables that act as both sources and listeners. | ##### Basic Syntax |

### Introduction
RSJX comes with built in observables with tools to allow them to handle async
easier

**Resources**
[Learn Rxjs](https://www.learnrxjs.io/)

### How It Works
RXJS works on the Observer Pattern
![[Pasted image 20250218205246.png|500]]

- RXJS creates `observables` that emit values over time. 
- You can "subscribe" to these observables using `Observers` which can be transformed using `Operators`
- Dataflow is controlled through `subscriptions`


#### **Creating and Observable**
**Example 1**: Create an observable that emits a value over time
```typescript
const observable$ = new Observable(subscriber => {
  subscriber.next("hello");
  subscriber.next("Rxjs");
  setTimer(() => {
    subscriber.next("Done!");
    subscriber.complete();
  }, 1000)
});
```
1. create the Observable
2. Emit values -   `subscriber.next("value")`
  - the first two next are emitted to all subscribers immediately, the last
    within the `setTimer` are delayed by 1 second
3. subscriber.complete - marks the observable as finished. 


### The `of` and `from` functions

**`of()`**
- This is an observable operator that will create an observable based off some
  value
- Not really useful in real world scenario, but is good to demonstrate usefulness
  of observables
- This method will create on observable of a data type. This observable will 
  update its subscribers when the data is updated

note: convention when creating observables is to add $ at the end of the identifier

**Example 1**:  Create an observable string that will serve an array of numbers
    - we use `of` to serve the array [1,2,3,4,5] to all of its subscribers
```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
    const numObservable$ = of([1,2,3,4,5]);

    // subscribe to the observable with this
    numObservable$.subscribe((data) => {
      console.log("Subscribed: " , data);
    })
  }
}
```

**`from()`**
-  creates and observable just like `of()` but serves in a different way. 
> instead of sending the entire array it will serve each element of the array
> on element at a time

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
    const numObservable$ = from([1,2,3,4,5]);

    // subscribe to the observable with this
    numObservable$.subscribe((data) => {
      console.log("Subscribed: " , data);
    })
  }
}
```



### Using RXJS in Angular Framework
While above is a cool example, we want to actually use this in our framework. Take from for example. Lets modify AppComponent
```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  data: number = 0;
  constructor() {
	const numObservable$ = from([1,2,3,4,5]);

	// subscribe to the observable with this
	numObservable$.subscribe((data) => {
	  console.log("Subscribed: " , data);
	- this.data = data
	})
  }
}
```
- now add it to the template for AppComponent
```html
<h1>Subscribers</h1>
{{ data }}
```

Here the value "5" was rendered because the observable in this case stored the values in the variable
but the last value in the list was the number 5 so fast was the last value in the stream. 



### Converting JS Data
We can convert plain javascript data into stream just as we did above.. 

**Example 1**: Converting List of User Objects to an observable stream
    - In this case we are using of because we want to get all of the users at
      once. Doesn't seem efficient to get them one at a time
```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
    const users = [
      {id: 1, name: "john", age: 44},
      {id: 2, name: "Jack", age: 23},
      {id: 1, name: "Jill", age: 54},
    ]

    // create observable
    user$ - of(users);

    //create observer
    user$.subscribe((users) => {
      console.log("Users: " , users)
    })
  }
}
```

**Example 1**: Observe a javascript promise
- with `Promise` you always want to use `from()` because if you do not and use
  the `of` operator then you will only return the promise
```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
     const users = [
      {id: 1, name: "john", age: 44},
      {id: 2, name: "Jack", age: 23},
      {id: 1, name: "Jill", age: 54},
    ]

    const messagePromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
	resolve('Promise Resolved')
      }, 1000)
    })

    const messagePromise$ = from(messagePromise);
    messagePromise$.subscribe((message) => {
      console.log("Message": message)
    })

  }
}
```
