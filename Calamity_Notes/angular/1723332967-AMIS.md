<h1>Angular Deferrable Views</h1>

- Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller
  - Bundles are what gets shipped to the client. This matters because you may have clients with low bandwidth. Also 
    you juust want to make sure your app is performant so you can load resources only as you need. 

With deferrable views, you can actually lazy load from the template level
```typescript 
<button #trigger>Load Recommended Movies</button>

@defer (on interaction(trigger)) {
  <recommended-movies />

} @loading {
  <p>Loading</p>

} @error {
  <p>Oops, Sorry</p>

} @placeholder {
  <img src="placeholder-image.png" />
}
```
 - the defer decorator will only load the section when interacting with the trigger FROM THE TEMPLATE/HTML level!
 - the trigger is a template variable
      Loading = What you show while you are fetching the http request (any html any
                 component)
      Error = what you display if there was an error loading 
      Placeholder = You can  display something while the data is being loading in flight.


###### Custom defered loading
\---------------------------

- you can also load based on custom logic. For example:

```typescript

<button (click)="Count = count + 1">
  Add One
</button>

@defer (when count > 5) {
    <recommended-movies />
  }
@placeholder {
    Count is {{ count }}
  }

```
- where did "count" come from in this template? It came from the ApplicationClass of the component and is programatic now
So we can programmatically decide when to load as well. ( OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!~!!!!!)



###### Triggers
\---------------------------
- you don't have to just use interaction trigger to load defers, there are many triggers that can be used
- Triggers

 -- Example of triggers with old angular syntax: 

| Trigger          | Description                                     | Example                                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `idle`             | Fires when the browser is idle.                 | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'idle'">...</ng-container>` |
| `interaction`      | Fires after a user interaction.                 | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'interaction'">...</ng-container>` |
| `timer`            | Fires after a specified time.                   | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'timer'">...</ng-container>` |
| `visible`          | Fires when the element becomes visible.         | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'visible'">...</ng-container>` |
| `immediate`        | Fires immediately when the component loads.     | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'immediate'">...</ng-container>` |
| `custom`           | Fires based on a custom condition.              | `<ng-container *ngIf="defer.trigger === 'custom'">...</ng-container>` |

todo: go through documentation and record information on the possible triggers : [https://angular.dev/guide/performance]

#### Prefetching
---

With prefetching, unlike lazy loading, you can have your code fetch the resource but not display it till a condition is met
```typescript
@defer (on interaction(trigger); prefetch on idle ) {
  <recommended-movies />
}

@defer (on interaction(trigger); 
	prefetch when count > 5 ) {
      <recommended-movies />
}

@defer (on interaction(trigger); prefetch when count > 5 ) {
      <recommended-movies />
    }
```
- the first defer, you can load on interaction, or if the page is loaded start prefetching the code to get it ready
- the second defer means prefetc if the counter reaches 5, or load on interaction
