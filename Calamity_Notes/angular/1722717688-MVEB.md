<h1> Creating an Angular Component</h1>
</center>


1) import component from angular at the file level 
```js 
import {Component} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',				            // tag name given to a component
  standalone: true,				                // flag to determine if there are                                                     dependent modules or not
  template: `<h1>Hey, Frontend Masters!</h1>`,  // template (can be a file if                                                         really big) for the page
  styles: `h1 {color: red`,                     // styles for the component (can                                                      be a seperate file). Styles are                                                    also scoped to the component! 
})
class AppComponent {}
```
- We use decorators in angular to add behavior to a property or a class , angular uses 
  these to add behavior  to a typescript class

#### Adding HTML/CSS Files to component
---

Its best practice not to code your html template directly in the component and insteasd move it 
to its own file:
```typescript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  templateURL: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.css'
})
class AppComponent {}
```

  - by convention, you make the html file like   (componentname).component.html

  - You write the realitive path to the component in templateURL property 
    (in this case its in the same location so its ./(component name) but it its not, you relative path from app component)

  -  In this file you write your html. It should look like: ![[Pasted image 20240814195337.png|400]]

note: you an also do the same with css file as you see above


note: if you are going to add image assets to your project, make sure to add to angular.json file 
like so:
```typescript

```

#### Creating/Generating and Managing Components With Angular CLI
---

Its not a good idea to create all of your components in the app folder. It will get really big. So by
convention you should create new sub folders in our app component named with the feature the component supports

(todo: link to Angular File Structure Notes from here)

This section is not about that, this section is about creating new components with the angular cli
- this will generate a new component for you. From terminal run:
```bash
# to add directly to app folder
ng generate component <name>

#or
ng g c <name>


```
