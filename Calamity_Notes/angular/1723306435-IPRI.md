```typescript
import  { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class CarService{...}
```
- Injectable: This decorator makes this typescript class injectable to other compontents. In this case we want this class
  to be provided to the whole application so we provide it in root. 
- ProvidedIn: 'root' - Where the injectable is provided.. In this case the resources is provided in root.  
	      root means available to entire application
- After adding this decorator, the class is "business as usual". Meaning you can just perform your basic operations from here

```typescript
import {inject} from '@angular/core';

@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
  carService = inject(CarService);
}

- we import thte inject method from core, and we use that in our component class to
