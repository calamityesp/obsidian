#### Using Components within Components
---

- A single component is like a block but if you leverage multiple components together,
  you unlock the power of component based architecture

###### Component Composition
\---------------------------

- Currently as of angular 17, this is the process you need to perform if you want to import a component
  into another component:

  ```javascript
  import {UserInfoComponent} from './user-info.component'

  @Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  template: `
    <section>
      <p> Welcome Back </p>
      <app-user-info />
    </section>
  `,
  imports: [UserInfoComponent]
  })

  export class DashboardComponent {}

  ```
  
	- first you import the component from its file directory
	- Then in the component, current you need to add the Imported component to the imports list note: Dev teams for angular are looking at ways to fix this, but this allows you to have Modular less components that are standalone
	- To use the component you call it like a html tag ( app-user-info)
