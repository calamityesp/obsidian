<h1>Directive Decorator</h1>
</center>


Like a parasite, you can add a directive as an attribute to an html element and trigger its behavior

example: 
```typescript
@Directive({
    selector: '[my-selector]'
})
```
- now in css attach some styles to the `my-selector` selector

```css
my-selector {
  background-color: red;
}
```
- now you can attach this Directive to a html element like this:
```html
<some-element my-selector></some-element>
```


---
#### Host Binding
---

This is a way to bind the directive to the host its attached to and act on its properties
- Example:
```typescript
import { Directive, HostBinding } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[randomColor]',
})
export class RandomColor {
  @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') color = `#${Math.floor(
    Math.random() * 16777215
  ).toString(16)}`;
}
```
> This applies a random color to the Host element everytime the directive is triggered


---
#### Using Directives in NgModule
---
If you want to use this you have to add the directive to the NgModule declarations
- Example snippet of adding RandomColor to the module
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    SettingsComponent,
    WelcomeComponent,
    RandomColor,
  ],
```
