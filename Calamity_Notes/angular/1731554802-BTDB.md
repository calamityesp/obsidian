<h1>Anatomy of @NgModule</h1>
</center>

Modules in angular are designated by the decorator @NgModule and are used to encapsulate components and make them
available to each other

1) Setting up your app to use modules
- in `main.ts` you will add the following bootstrap
```javascript
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err))
```
- this is used to bootstrap your application for modules 
- App Component is supplied to the @NgModule via the AppModule component
  (you can reference a project to see the flow)


###### How to organize your modules
\---------------------------

Instead of putting all of your components into a siingle module, you would typically have a module for each feature
of your application to create some modularity with your features
```text
eg:
AppModule
HomeModule
SettingsModule
```
- Makinig features module allows us to `lazy load` features of our application

#### Anatomy of @NgModule
---

##### AppModule
default directory: /src/app/AppModule.ts

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
- This is app / root module
- It has the root component as a declaration so its avaiable to the module

THINK:
> - decorations:  What I create for my module
> - imports:      What do I need for my module


##### AppComponent
- App component imports RouterOutlet, which means it now has access to AppRoutingModule

> You import router outlet for any components thats going to render another component based
> on route.. and you are usiing the importing component as layout

#### Examples of using Modules
---

Example of the home.module.ts file and home.component.ts
```javascript
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { Component, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { RandomColor } from './ui/random-color.directive';
import { ReversePipe } from './ui/reverse.pipe';
import { WelcomeComponent } from './ui/welcome.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  template: `
    <app-welcome
      [name]="user.name"
      (cookiesAccepted)="handleCookies()"
    ></app-welcome>
    <p>I am the home component</p>
    <p randomColor>{{ 'reverse me ' | reverse }}</p>
  `,
})
export class HomeComponent {
  user = {
    name: 'Josh',
  };

  handleCookies() {
    console.log('do something');
  }
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    RouterModule.forChild([
      {
        path: '',
        component: HomeComponent,
      },
    ]),
  ],
  declarations: [HomeComponent, WelcomeComponent, ReversePipe, RandomColor],
})
export class HomeModule {}
```

- @NgModule:  Container for everything that will be aware of the existance of the HomeComponent, and other Pipes, modules
              or decorator
              This module has everything we need for our `Home Feature`. 
  1) declarations: declare any individual component/directive/pipe we want to be able to use within our home feature
  2) imports:      generally the same as the imports array in 'standalone' components except we import whole modules and 
                   anything the module we import exports will be available within HomeModule
  3) commonModule - RouterModule: provided by angular and we are importing them into our HomeModule to use whats they 
                                  export
                                  - commonModule exports a bunch of pipes and directives (look it up to see them all)
