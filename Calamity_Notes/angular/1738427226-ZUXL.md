### Rxjs and Signals

**Reactive Programming (rsjx and signals):**
If we have components  A ,B, C ,and D and we want B,C,D to react to changes in 
component A, this is the premise of Reactive Programming
![[Pasted image 20250201094122.png]]

Example: Count and double count
```typescript
count = signal(0); // signal with inital value of 0
doubleCount = computed(() => this.count() *2);    // reacts to count changes, and doubles it
```

You can do the same with RXJS and Observables
```typescript
count$ = new BehaviorSubject(0);
doubleCount$ = this.count$.pipe(map((count) => count * 2));
```
- note `$` is just convention for observables

In above case signals are better because you can access signal values where ever
you want, were as observable streams you need to subscribe
```typescript
// accessing signal data
someMethod() {
  this.signalVariable()               //access the value
}


// accessing observable (subscribe to observable)
this.$doublecount.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(value);
})
// note: to avoid memory leaks with rxjs you need to unsubscribe at somepoint
```

If you want to access observables from a template, you need to use azure async
pipe
```html
{{ doubleCount$ | async}}   <!--async handles unsubscribe for us-->
```


### Why use Rxjs?

Observables and signals suit different tasks.
**Observables**:
- great for managing events
- asynchronous reactivity
    - A updates from remote server (http), B waits patiently for updates

**Signals**:
- great for managing state
- synchronous reactivity (the image above)
    - A updates B reacts instantly with value update

note: Resource api with signals allow you to do some asynchronous tasks with 
      signals as well. But above is still useful

Combine for the best of both worlds: 
- Great for state
- Great for events
- Great for synchronous reactivity
- Great for asynchronous reactivity
