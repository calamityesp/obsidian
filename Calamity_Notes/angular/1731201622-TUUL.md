We use @Injectables for dependency injections

1) We can use Injectable to define services (business logic such as api calls) and cache data in "singleton objects"
   (entire application)  can share same instance of a class)
2) We then "inject" that service iinto whatever component needs to use it. 


```javascript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'     //proviiding this in root means its shared with entire application
})
export class DataService {
  someData = 'multiple components can share/access me!'

  someMethod(){
    // Any component that injects me can access me!
    // I might just return some data
    // or I might update this.someData so that all of the
    // components who inject me can get the updated data!
  }
}
```

To use this (or dependency inject this) into a component, you would need to add it to the "providers" property of the
decorator (module or component) - note: providedIn property of injectable decorator handles this dependiing where 
the injectable is provided, otherwise you will need to do like below:

```javascript
@Component({
  standalone: true, 
  selector: 'app-home',
  template:`<p>I am  the home component</p>`,
  providers:[DataService]
})
```
- note: providiing the DataService like this with the "providers" property will supply the component its own instance 
	of the service and it will not share with other components liike usiing providedIn property in the service

#### Using (injecting) service in another component
---

You can inject the service using the class constructor

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data-access/data.service';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-home',
  template: `
    <p>I am the home component</p>
`
})
export class HomeComponent {
  constructor (dataService: DataService) {
    console.log(dataService.someData)
  }
}
```
- here we declare the constructor, and we inject the service by adding it to the parameter, and Angular (if the service
  is registered iini Proviided in, or from root) into our service
- dataService will be injected with whatever type token iits assigned


There is new syntax for injecting services using the "inject" keyword from angular core
```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService }  from './data-access/data.service';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-home',
  template:`
    <p>I am the home component</p>
`
})
export class HomeComponent {
  dataService = inject(DataService)
}
```
