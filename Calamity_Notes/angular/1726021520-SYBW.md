<h1>Angular: Binding to Properties vs Attributes </h1>
</center>

In Angular, you can bind to both **properties** and **attributes**, but they work differently.

---
## Property vs Attribute
---




---
## Property Binding
---

Angular primarily works with **DOM properties**. When you use property binding, you're changing the property 
of an element, not the HTML attribute.

For example, to bind the `src` property of an image:
```html
<img [src]="imageUrl">
```
This will bind to the src property of the `<img>` element, changing the image dynamically based on the dynamicImageUrl.

---
## Attribute Binding
---

If you need to bind to an HTML attribute instead of a property, use the attr. prefix. This is useful for attributes
that do not have corresponding DOM properties, like aria-label or href.
