### Overview
Msal library is an openid connect wrapper for Microsoft Azure which helps your 
angular application get authentication tokens from Azure Auth services

MSAL provides a consistent api across multiple platforms:
- No need to use OAuth Libraries or code against protocol
- Maintains a token cache, and handles token refresh
- Helps Identify your audience you want to sign into
- Helps setup application from configuration files
- Helps with troubleshooting exposing exceptions, logging, and telemetry

##### Authentication Flows
| Authentication Flow               | Enables                                                     | Supported Application Types               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Authorization code                | User sign-in and access to web APIs.                        | Desktop, Mobile, SPA (requires PKCE), Web |
| Client credentials                | Server-to-server API access without user interaction.       | Daemon                                    |
| Device code                       | User sign-in on input-limited devices (TVs, IoT, CLI apps). | Desktop, Mobile                           |
| Implicit grant                    | User sign-in and API access (not recommended).              | SPA, Web                                  |
| On-behalf-of (OBO)                | Pass user identity between APIs.                            | Web API                                   |
| Username/password (ROPC)          | Direct user sign-in with password (not recommended).        | Desktop, Mobile                           |
| Integrated Windows authentication | Silent sign-in on domain-joined computers.                  | Desktop, Mobile                           |


##### Public Client and Confidential Client Applications

MSAL defines two types of clients: `Public and confidential`

- Public Client Apps: unique identifier used by an identity provider
> Not trusted to keep application secrets, transmission of this id can be viewed
> by untrusted parties

- Private Confidential Apps: Run on servers, daemons, web apis, trusted resources
> Considerd difficult to access by untrusted parties. Client ID are exposed but 
> the resource uses a "secret" to assert proof of its identity


### Initialize Client Applications

Recommended way is to use the application builders
- `PublicClientApplicationBuilder`, `ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder`

You will need the following to initialize:
- Application (client) ID: (guid string from azure)
- Directory (Tenent) ID - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Identity provider URL - instance and sign-in audience (known as `Authority`)
- Client Credentials - (client secret or certificate if its confidential client) 
- Redirect URI - (for web apps) Where your identity provider will send your
                 security token


### Initializing Public and Confidential Client Applications from Code

- Public Client
```cs
IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
                               .Create(clientId).Build()
```

- Confidiential Client
```cs
string redirectUri = "https://myapp.azurewebsites.net";
IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithRedirectUri(redirectUri )
    .Build();
```
